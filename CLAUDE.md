# CLAUDE.md

Huronalytics — a public baseball leaderboard and a set of derived metrics, built from Google Sheets and the MLB/Savant feeds, published as a static site.

- `pipeline/` — the build. Sheets in, leaderboard JSON and gzipped embeds out. Entry point `python3 -m pipeline.process_data`.
- `stuff_plus/` — the one offline-trained model (xgboost). Runs in CI after the pipeline, injects scores back into the leaderboard JSONs.
- `scrapers/` — feed and Savant pulls, plus the Sheets append path.
- `cards/` — matplotlib pitcher and hitter cards.
- `js/`, `css/`, `index.html`, `trade.html` — the site. Vanilla JS, no build step, no framework.
- `R-scripts/` — the printed pitcher reports.
- `scripts/` — everything that is not the build. `scripts/README.md` is the authority on its layout; read it before adding a file there.

Nested rules live in `pipeline/CLAUDE.md` and `js/CLAUDE.md`. Longer workflows live as skills in `.claude/skills/`. Do not paste them here.

The global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` carries the tuning-constant rule (never estimate a constant, sweep it until an interior optimum is bracketed or the curve is proven flat). It applies to every number in this repo. It is not repeated below.

## Write all replies in Simplified Technical English

Write every reply in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. This rule applies to all replies in a conversation. It applies at turn 200 the same as at turn 1. A long conversation is not a reason to stop.

The rule governs replies to the user. It does not govern code, code comments, commit messages, or file content, which follow the conventions of the file they go in.

The core rules:

- Write one instruction in one sentence. Do not join two instructions with "and".
- Keep procedural sentences to 20 words or fewer. Keep descriptive sentences to 25 words or fewer.
- Keep a paragraph to 6 sentences or fewer.
- Use the active voice. Write "The pipeline writes the file." Do not write "The file is written."
- Use the simple present tense when you can. Use the simple past tense for a completed action.
- Use one approved word for one meaning. Do not use a synonym for variety.
- Write the article. Write "the file", not "file".
- Do not use a verb in the -ing form, unless it is part of a technical name.
- Do not use contractions. Write "do not", not "don't".
- Do not use slang, idiom, or a figure of speech.
- Start a warning with the command. Start a caution with the condition.

Number the steps of a procedure. State the result of a step if the result is not obvious.

## Ask before you assume

Never guess at intent. If a task leaves anything open — which metric, which season, which player pool, whether a change ships or stays research — stop and ask. One question up front is cheaper than half a day in the wrong direction.

- Ask when the request could reasonably mean two different things.
- Ask before changing a shipped metric's definition, a column set, or anything that lands in `data/*_rs.json`.
- A request is a hypothesis, not an order. If the thing asked for has no value, or the value is already captured by something shipped, say so before building it.
- Do not widen scope past what was asked. Note the adjacent thing you spotted, do not fix it unprompted.
- Do not "clean up" from a snapshot whose age you have not checked.
- If you had to assume something you could not resolve, list it explicitly at the top of your summary.

## The loop

There are two loops here and they are not interchangeable. Pick by what you changed.

### Code changes (refactors, plumbing, moves, new columns)

The proof is byte-identical output, not a test suite.

```bash
# copy scripts/tools/golden_harness somewhere disposable first
python3 capture_inputs.py                          # once: freeze Sheets rows (2m30s)
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python3 golden_run.py prestate    # ~3s
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python3 golden_run.py run BASE    # 5m45s
# ... make the change ...
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python3 golden_run.py run CHANGE  # 5m45s
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python3 golden_run.py compare BASE CHANGE
```

Budget about 15 minutes for a full verification. Measured 2026-08-17 on 583,619 frozen rows.

Then, on real output:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.process_data
python3 scripts/ci/validate_output.py
```

Rules:

- Capture, baseline, and verify in the **same session**. Day-boundary cache drift is real, and comparing runs from different days proves nothing.
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` on every golden run. Without it the diff is noise.
- A behavior-neutral change that does not reproduce the baseline is not behavior-neutral. Find out why before shipping.
- If the change is intentionally behavior-changing, say what should differ **before** you run the compare, then confirm only that differed.

### Metric changes (a new stat, a re-weighting, a shrinkage constant, a gate)

A within-season holdout is not green. It has passed while the config lost every independent replicate.

- Rebuild self-contained on each of 2021 through 2025, plus the live season. Require the config to win in most of the seasons it was never fitted to.
- Report the objective that decided it, the grid, and the curve. "Best on the grid," "optimal," and "flat, so anything here works" are three different claims.
- Check the objective cannot be gamed by the direction you are searching. Reliability inflates under smoothing toward a constant. That makes it a diagnostic, not an objective.
- Tune at the sample size production actually runs at.
- Validate any replication against a known-shipped value before you trust it.

Rules for both loops:

- Never report success on a red loop. Never loosen a gate or narrow a pool to get a number to pass.
- If a check is wrong, say so and explain why before changing it.
- Do not start long-running processes to "verify." Use the commands above.

## Numeric correctness

There is no type checker here. The boundary discipline has to be explicit instead, because every one of these has silently corrupted output at least once.

- **No silent `fillna`.** A missing value is either meaningful (impute it deliberately, with the frozen constant written down) or a bug. Never `.fillna(0)` to make a computation run.
- **NaN is not zero.** A NaN arm angle, a NaN velocity, and a missing pitch type are different failures and none of them are `0`.
- **Full precision until display.** `runValue`, `xRunValue`, `rv100`, `xRv100` are summed and aggregated at full precision. Rounding happens in the display layer only.
- **Sheet writes use `USER_ENTERED` with a text-forced Count and NaN mapped to blank.** `RAW` plus `str` stores numerics as text, which breaks sorting and renders `<NA>`.
- **Parse the feed, do not trust the shape.** Outs come from per-pitch `count.outs`, not `about.outs`. Pitcher and batter attribution handles mid-PA subs. Savant `pitch_number` counts auto balls and the feed does not.
- **Currency is not universal.** MiLB RunExp is league-denominated in the raw cache. Any pickle reader converts with `compute_runexp_scale` from `pipeline/utils.py`.
- **One home per constant.** The retired `PITCHING_W_STUFF` once ran 70/30 in one file and 80/20 in another for about three weeks; the outing Pitching+ constants live in `cards/pitcher.py` (`PP_OUTING_*`) and nowhere else.
- **The qualification constants are the exception, and they are paired by hand.** Seven of them exist twice, in `pipeline/utils.py` and in the `QUAL` block of `js/aggregator.js`, because JS cannot import Python. Change one and you change the other in the same commit, or the site colors rows the pipeline did not qualify.
- **Same name does not mean same quantity.** `CELL_SHRINK_K` is 3 in `xwoba3d.py` and 50 in `sdplus.py` and `contact.py`. `HITTER_PRIOR_N` is 190 and 66. `MIN_POOL` counts pitchers in one file and pitches in another. Each was measured independently and each is correct. Do not "unify" them.

Respect these from the start. Do not write loose code and fix it after the output looks wrong.

## Naming

Pick the existing word. Do not coin a new one.

**Domain vocabulary, one word per concept.** This table starts empty on purpose. A row earns its place when a real synonym conflict is found in this repo, not when one seems plausible. An invented "never" is worse than no row, because it reads as authority and can send an agent to "fix" correct code.

| Concept | Use | Never |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _(none yet)_ | | |

Before adding a row, grep for both spellings and confirm the loser is genuinely a mistake rather than a different concept wearing a similar name.

**Code:**

- Metric modules are named for the metric: `locplus.py`, `sdplus.py`, `commandplus.py`.
- Research scripts are `scripts/research/<topic>/<what_it_tests>.py`, run from the repo root.
- Scratch artifacts get a leading underscore: `data/_era_battery.json`. Shipped artifacts do not.
- Shipped leaderboard artifacts end `_rs.json`.
- Scripts compute the repo root from `__file__`. Same-folder imports are bare, cross-folder imports carry their own `sys.path.insert` next to the import.

**Display conventions.** These are wrong in output more often than anything else:

- No leading `+` on positive numbers. Negatives still take `-`. The one exception is a parenthesised vs-baseline delta, which is signed both ways.
- Three-decimal rate stats drop the leading zero: `.318`, not `0.318`. ERA, FIP, and velocity keep theirs.
- Date columns in any CSV deliverable are ISO `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- No em-dashes in prose, copy, or article drafts. Commas, colons, periods.

## Project structure

```
pipeline/          # the build: fetch -> compute -> process_data -> data/
  utils.py         #   shared constants and helpers, single home for weights
  process_data.py  #   entry point, python3 -m pipeline.process_data
stuff_plus/        # xgboost trainer + cached model bundle
scrapers/          # feed/Savant pulls, sheets_append
cards/             # matplotlib pitcher + hitter cards
js/ css/           # the site, no build step
R-scripts/         # printed pitcher reports
scripts/           # everything else, see scripts/README.md
data/              # artifacts. _-prefixed = research scratch
```

- New metric math goes in `pipeline/`. New research goes in `scripts/research/<topic>/`.
- `scripts/ci/` paths are pinned in `.github/workflows/update-leaderboard.yml`. Move them only in lockstep with it.
- `scripts/abs_daily.py` and `scripts/auto-pull.sh` are pinned by launchd. Moving them breaks the daily run.
- Nothing new at the repo root without asking.

## Dependencies

Code is cheap, maintenance is not. Prefer the standard library, then numpy/pandas, then a well-established package.

- `requirements.txt` is the full local environment. CI installs a smaller subset inline in the workflow. Adding a pipeline dependency means editing **both**.
- `xgboost==3.4.1` is pinned exactly on purpose (3.3.0 until 2026-09-02; any pin change owes a retrain, because model output is version-sensitive and a bundle pickled under one version must be scored under the same one).
- Ask before adding a dependency. Never add one as a side effect of another task.
- `.venv/` is load-bearing for the IDE. Never delete it.

## Performance

There is no server, so the budgets are build time and payload.

- **Payload.** Per-visitor bytes and main-thread parse are the real cost. The embed is sharded and split across `data_core` / `data_tables` / `data_heavy` for that reason. Anything that moves data into `data_core` needs a stated reason.
- **CI.** A score-only run is roughly a minute. A retrain is 30 to 40 minutes and runs only on `-f retrain=true`. Do not make a normal run pay retrain cost.
- **Savant pulls** cap at 25k rows per request. Page or narrow the query, do not assume a full result.
- **Vectorize.** Per-row Python over a pitch-level frame is a bug, not a tuning opportunity. These frames run to hundreds of thousands of rows.
- Cache expensive pulls in `data/`, and say in the summary what you cached and what you re-pulled.

## Error handling

The failure mode here is not a crash, it is a silently wrong number reaching the site.

**Fail closed.** On 2026-08-12 a `curl` without `-f` wrote an HTTP error page into the model bundle, and the Stuff+ and Pitching+ columns were blanked in every workbook. Nothing errored.

- Never write a partial artifact. Build to a temp path and move, or do not write.
- A missing input never silently blanks a column. Either abort or preserve the prior value, and log which one happened.
- Every fallback announces itself. `0 Stuff+ grades` in a CI log is the shape of tell that should exist for every degrade path.
- No bare `except:`. No `except Exception: pass`. Catch the specific thing and handle it, or let it propagate.
- Downloads use `curl -sfL --retry 3`. Without `-f` an error body becomes a corrupt file, which surfaces as a confusing decompression error rather than a download failure.
- Error messages name the repair tool. If the fix is `scripts/ops/fix_unformatted_blocks.py --apply`, the message says so.
- Never edit an artifact in `data/` by hand to make a number look right.

## End-to-end verification

After any change that spans the pipeline and the site, exercise it the way a visitor would.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.process_data
python3 scripts/ci/validate_output.py
# serve the site: preview config "site" in .claude/launch.json, port 8899
```

- Pick a real player you know the numbers for and check the value on the page against the shipped value. Not a synthetic row.
- Check a qualified hitter, an unqualified hitter, and a ROC player. They render differently by design.
- Check the leaderboard, a player page, and the filtered view. Filters reshape team numbers, so a change can be right in one and wrong in another.
- Report what you loaded and what you saw. If a step failed, keep the failure. Do not work around it and call it passing.

## Visual checking

A passing validation says nothing about whether the page or the card looks right.

- Screenshot every card or view you touch and look at it before saying it is done.
- Pitch colors are Okabe-Ito, sinker is amber everywhere. The site and cards share one palette.
- There is no dark palette in `js/`. Do not add one.
- Check: clipped labels, overlapping annotations, a legend that lost a pitch type, an empty state, a player with one pitch type, a player with seven.
- Use a real qualified player and a real unqualified one. Unqualified renders hatched by design, that is not a bug.
- ROC team rows show but stay uncolored. Confirm that still holds after any coloring change.

## Architecture

Read this before exploring. If you find yourself searching for something that belongs here, add it.

Build path: Google Sheets (six per-division workbooks) → `pipeline.fetch` → `pipeline.process_data` → leaderboard JSONs plus `data_core` / `data_tables` / `data_heavy` gzipped embeds plus shards → static site.

Stuff+ is trained offline and runs after the pipeline in CI, injecting scores into the leaderboard JSONs, after which `rebuild_embed.py` swaps them into `data_core.json.gz`. Normal runs score with a cached fold bundle, which is leakage-free for new pitches. A retrain is deliberate and manual.

The workflow is manual dispatch only. There is no schedule. Every run is an intentional update.

**Where things live:**

| You need | Look in |
| --- | --- |
| The build entry point | `pipeline/process_data.py` |
| Shared constants, weights, currency helpers | `pipeline/utils.py` |
| Loc+ / SD+ / CT+ / Command+ / ERA+ math | `pipeline/locplus.py`, `sdplus.py`, `contact.py`, `commandplus.py`, `eraplus.py` |
| Stuff+ training and features | `stuff_plus/train_stuff.py` |
| Feed and Savant pulls | `scrapers/pitcher2026.py` |
| Sheets append path | `scrapers/sheets_append.py` |
| The output gate | `scripts/ci/validate_output.py` |
| Regression proof | `scripts/tools/golden_harness/` |
| Everything under scripts/ | `scripts/README.md` |
| Site rendering and coloring | `js/leaderboard.js`, `js/player-page.js` |
| Data loading and cache-bust stamp | `js/data.js` |
| CI pipeline | `.github/workflows/update-leaderboard.yml` |

The pre-commit hook bumps the `?v=` cache-bust stamp whenever `js/` or `css/` changes. Install it once with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Without it, a JS edit will not reach browsers.

## Keeping this file current

This file is a failure log, not a wishlist. Every line below exists because it went wrong at least once.

When you make a mistake, get corrected, or discover something about this repo that was not written down:

1. Add one line to the failure log below, in the imperative, describing the correct behaviour.
2. Keep it **mechanical and repo-specific**: run this before that, this file is generated, this path is pinned. Decision history, metric rationale, and what-we-tried-and-rejected belong in the memory directory, not here. Two homes for the same fact means one of them goes stale unnoticed.
3. If the fix is a workflow rather than a rule, put it in `.claude/skills/` and link it from here.
4. Include the change in the same commit and mention it in your summary.

Keep this file under 500 lines. It loads into every session, and long context makes you less reliable, not more. If a section outgrows its usefulness, move it to `pipeline/CLAUDE.md`, `js/CLAUDE.md`, or a skill.

## Failure log

- Run the golden harness capture, baseline, and verification in one session. Never compare runs made on different days.
- Set `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` on every golden run, or the comparison is noise.
- Copy `scripts/tools/golden_harness/` somewhere disposable before running it. Its state lives next to the scripts and grows to several GB.
- The harness cannot restore a file over 100 MB (`COPY_LIMIT`); it hashes those instead. `data/all_pitches_rs_cache.pkl` is one, so a run leaves its own output there. Untracked and rebuildable, but the harness will not undo damage to it.
- The harness `WATCH` list is `data`, `js`, `index.html`, and a golden run RESTORES those trees to its prestate when it finishes. Never edit a watched tree while a golden run is in flight: on 2026-08-27 an uncommitted `js/aggregator.js` edit made mid-BASE was silently wiped by the restore. Commit or hold watched-tree edits until the harness session is over. The pipeline also stamps `trade.html` and `catch.html`, which are therefore **not** restored: a run rolls their `?v=` back to the run's own timestamp. Check `git status` after any golden run and `git checkout -- trade.html catch.html` if they moved.
- The reorg left stale `pipeline_utils` / `pipeline_fetch` / `pipeline_compute` names in about 17 comments. They are navigation traps, not bugs. Fix one when you touch the line, and check any such reference resolves before trusting it.
- Do not hand-edit `data/` artifacts. Regenerate them.
- Republish the release assets after **any** pickle augmentation, or CI scores against a stale bundle.
- `curl` in CI needs `-f`. Without it an HTTP error body lands in the file and surfaces as a decompression failure.
- `0 Stuff+ grades` in the CI log means the grade dump is missing. The run is bad even though it succeeded.
- Do not move anything in `scripts/ci/` without editing `.github/workflows/update-leaderboard.yml` in the same commit.
- Do not move `scripts/abs_daily.py` or `scripts/auto-pull.sh`. launchd pins their paths.
- The settings blocks at the top of `scrapers/pitcher2026.py`, `cards/pitcher.py`, `cards/hitter.py` and the ford_comps scripts are per-run scratch. Every option-type card control (social, bats, rv_mode, layout, la_view, ...) ALWAYS gets a variable in that block with the CLI flag as override — never a CLI-only option (per Wally 2026-08-27). Stage files explicitly when committing logic changes so team, dates, and player_id edits do not ride along. Reset the dates to `None` in the committed version: a shipped `start_date` makes a bare run render a window instead of the season. A swap-back that expects an exact scratch string silently no-ops when the user changed the block mid-session — twice on 2026-08-28 the scratch dates shipped anyway. After ANY commit touching these files, verify with `git show HEAD:<file> | grep start_date`; zsh can chain past a failed heredoc, so never trust the swap ran just because the commit did.
- Read the README in `archive/` and `scripts/archive/` before re-running anything there. Some of it is destructive.
- Concurrent sessions can swallow each other's staged files. Check `git status` before committing if another session is open.
- `.venv/` is load-bearing for the IDE. Never delete it.
- Player-ID pulls always produce a CSV and never push to Sheets. Only team and game modes push.
- Deliverables go to `~/Downloads/` as `.docx`, `.pdf`, or `.csv`, never `.md`. Analysis and utility scripts go to `scripts/`, never Downloads.
- Bunts are not swings. Foul Bunt and Missed Bunt stay out of Swing%, Whiff%, and Chase% for both sides.
- Barrel is the official `launch_speed_angle` column. Never substitute the EV/LA recompute, which undercounts by about 5%.
- Percentile pools are all MLB players. Qualification is a render-time coloring gate, not a pool filter.
- Hitter qualification is 3.1 PA times team games played. Never substitute swing count or BIP count.
- Never run bare `git commit` here. Use `git commit -- <paths>`. The index routinely holds work in progress (the `pitcher2026.py` settings block, R-scripts, cards), and a bare commit takes everything staged. On 2026-08-17 `c3b9ba28` swept five unrelated files into a commit whose message described only a scraper fix.
- `scripts/auto-pull.sh` runs `git pull --rebase --autostash` on a launchd timer. It can fire mid-session and leave the artifacts in `data/` conflicted, which makes the next commit fail. Reset them to HEAD; they are all regenerable.
- process_data CARRIES the inject keys (XRVOE_KEYS, Pitcher+ family) from the on-disk leaderboard artifact. A golden compare is only valid for those keys if `data/` did not move between the two runs — on 2026-08-28 an auto-pull landed fresh CI artifacts mid-harness and every carried key diffed without any behavior change. Check `git log data/` before reading a carried-key diff as real.
- Hitter `+` metrics are percents; pitcher `+` metrics are standard deviations, and that split is deliberate. Stuff+/Loc+ are borrowed public vocabulary built FanGraphs-style (Pitching+ is the outing grade since 2026-08-28 and deliberately includes a results term), so their 100 +/- 10 spread is the shared language and rescaling would cost cross-site comparability. Command+ is the one pitcher exception (a miss-distance ratio) because it is not shared vocabulary. Do not "unify" these.
- The `+` suffix is a contract: 100 is league average and one point is one percent. Hitter+/BB+/SD+/CT+ all honour it as of 2026-08-18. Never rescale a `+` stat to match another stat's spread — matching Hitter+ to wRC+'s full SD drops its slope to r and makes 115 worth 12%, not 15%. The deflation to `r x SD(wRC+)` IS the wRC+ scale.
- Hitter+'s run-truth `r` is measured LIVE each run so the slope stays exactly 1. A pool under 30 or an r outside 0.40-0.98 falls back to the frozen 0.82 and logs it. The value used ships in `metadata.hitterPlusStandardization.wrcScaleMatch.r`.
- Percentile precision differs by family: the pipeline ranks FULL-precision values (`process_data.py` says so where the ranks are computed), while the Stuff+ family ranks display-rounded ones (Stuff+ at 1 decimal, xRVOE/100 at 2, in `train_stuff.py`). Only in the second family can an affine rescale shift a few ranks by exactly 1 through tie-breaking; that is not a rank change. Check which family a stat is in before assuming either behaviour.
- An IBB is a PA. For HITTERS it also counts as a walk, so PA and BB% both include it; for PITCHERS BB% uses unintentional walks only, but the IBB still counts toward batters faced. The season path already does this via the boxscore merge. Pitch-derived paths CANNOT: a no-pitch IBB leaves no pitch, so they must merge an official line or they run short (Wood 449 PA against 454, BB% 16.5% against 17.4%).
- FanGraphs serves custom date ranges (`month=1000` plus `startdate`/`enddate`). `fg_overrides.fetch_mlb_hitters_range` uses it for the window official line. Do not conclude FG is season-only; that has been wrong twice.
- Date-window cards: VALUES come from the window, PERCENTILES come from the SEASON pool, and there is no sample-size gate (`pipeline/window_pool.py`). A three-week hot stretch is supposed to read as an elite percentile; that is what makes two windows comparable to each other. Do not rebuild a window-specific percentile pool - that was tried, it made every window its own ruler, and it needed a qualification gate that returned nothing on short ranges.
- The + family on a window is scored against SEASON league anchors and cell tables, never window-rebuilt ones, for the same reason.
- Percentile inversions (`HITTER_INVERT_PCTL`) are a SEPARATE pass in `process_data`, not part of `compute_percentile_ranks_with_aaa`. Any code that computes percentiles outside the pipeline must apply them, or K%/Chase%/Whiff%/GB% colour backwards and nothing errors.
- `scripts/builders/build_window_leaderboard.py START END [--cached]` is the EXACT window pool (real season code path, official-boxscore PA), at ~8 min. The card only uses it if it already exists; otherwise it builds its own in ~9s. Use the builder when PA must reconcile to official totals. `--cached` reuses `data/_window_pitches_cache.pkl` and skips the 2m30s Sheets read; drop it after Sheets is appended to.
- Never pass `window_mode=True` to `process_game_type` on a run that writes a shipped `_rs` artifact. It suppresses the FanGraphs wRC+/FIP overrides and the Savant sprint-speed merge on purpose, so its output is a window artifact only.
- Set `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` on window builds. A full-season control reproduced the shipped leaderboard on 150 of 164 keys, and the two rows that moved at the third decimal were both multi-team (2TM) rows, where aggregation order is not pinned.
- Column decimal depth is single-homed in `scrapers/sheet_precision.py`. `pitcher2026.py`, `backfill_full.py` and `backfill_supplement.py` all read it and none of them may carry a rounding list of its own, or a fresh scrape writes truncated values that the next sweep re-upgrades forever.
- Qualification is single-homed in `Utils.buildQualContext` / `Utils.isQualified` (`js/utils.js`). `js/aggregator.js`, `js/data.js` and `js/player-page.js` all call it and none of them may answer the question themselves. Three copies existed until 2026-08-19 and they disagreed on 16 MLB players.
- A multi-team label (`2TM` ... `10TM`) is a player, not a franchise, so it never supplies a team-games denominator. A multi-team player is measured against the club he most recently played for, resolved from `lastGameDate` on his MLB stint rows. Feeding the label to `teamGames` gave `2TM` a 144-game season, `3TM` a 109-game one, and `4TM` a threshold of zero.
- A ROC/AAA row never resolves a combined row. `Utils.playerKey` groups on `mlbId`, so a ROC stint of a traded player shares a key with his MLB rows, and the combined row is built from MLB stints only. `pipeline/compute.py:769` routes ROC rows out before the same check.
- Pitcher and hitter leaderboard rows both carry `lastGameDate`. Qualification reads it on both sides. Do not drop it from either row builder in `pipeline/process_data.py`.
- The pipeline resolves the same denominator through `current_team_by_player` / `is_combined_team` / `player_key` in `pipeline/utils.py`. They mirror `js/utils.js` and must move together, or the shipped percentile pool and the site's render gate disagree.
- `metadata.teamGamesPlayed` (30 MLB teams, from `compute_team_games_played`) and `metadata.teamGames` (33 entries, includes ROC 112 and the 2TM/3TM labels) are different dicts. The pipeline qualifiers use the first, the client uses the second. Never feed a combined label to either.
- Never commit the output of a local `python3 -m pipeline.process_data`. CI runs `stuff_plus/train_stuff.py` AFTER the pipeline and injects `stuffScore_lowSupport` plus the `rvoe`/`xrvoe` family into the leaderboards, so a local rebuild silently strips them (985 pitcher and 4573 pitch rows, measured 2026-08-19). Run it locally to verify, then `git checkout -- data/` and dispatch the workflow.
- `metadata.generatedAt` is the generating machine's LOCAL time with no timezone marker. CI writes UTC, a local run writes ET, so the site's "Generated" stamp can appear to move backwards after a local run. Compare commit times, not the stamp.
- Key every per-club lookup by MLB club id through `TEAM_ABBREV_TO_ID`, never by abbreviation. Savant spells six clubs `AZ`/`KC`/`SD`/`SF`/`TB`/`OAK` and the leaderboard spells them `ARI`/`KCR`/`SDP`/`SFG`/`TBR`/`ATH`; a hand-copied abbreviation map made 167 pitcher rows score hpERA against a neutral park for four days, with no error.
- Savant's rolling-3 park-factor endpoint OMITS any club whose venue lacks three seasons, and it does not narrow the window itself. `scripts/builders/park_factors_pull.py` cascades 3 to 2 to 1 and records the window under `_window`. Do not read that endpoint directly.
- ROC/AAA rows score hpERA but NOT hdERA. `apply_era_plus` needs `roc_pitches` passed in (train_stuff hands it the currency-corrected list) or every ROC row loses the xRV channel and hpERA stays None. ROC never enters the pool, the league rates or the z statistics, and its home park scores neutral because no minor-league park factors exist.
- A combined `2TM`..`10TM` row has no park of its own, so `apply_era_plus` resolves it as the MOST RECENT club's park via `current_team_by_player` (`combined_park_map`). Measured 2026-08-24: hpERA forecasts future runs, and IP-weighted stint history LOSES to the current club's park in every LOSO replicate. `park.get('2TM')` falls through to neutral, which scored 93 rows against a neutral park until 2026-08-19. ROC stints never resolve the club.
- The bulk stats endpoint (`stats?stats=season`) returns ONE season-combined row per pitcher with only the FINAL club attached. Per-team stints need the person hydrate (`/people?personIds=...&hydrate=stats(...)`), which also splits byDateRange pulls by team.
- Savant serves bat speed for ROC on EVENT pitches (balls in play and strikeouts) as of 2026-08-21, applied by hand to the AAA tab's `BatSpeed` column. `cards/hitter.py` used to drop the Bat Speed bubble on every ROC card on the assumption the value could never exist. A note that encodes "this can never happen" goes stale silently; gate on the data, not the assumption. The SAME trap sat on `armAngle` in `js/player-page.js`: `rocHide: true` hid it from the ROC arsenal table while 144 of 150 ROC pitch-type rows carried a value (found 2026-08-31). Before adding a `rocHide`, count the non-null ROC rows. The ROC value is event-only, the MLB value is every swing, and the card says so.
- R report tables drop an all-empty column by its SOURCE data (`STAT_COL_SOURCE` / `keep_populated_cols` in `pitcher_report_utils.R`), never by the rendered string. Zone% and GB% print a false `0.0%` when `InZone` or `BBType` is empty, because both divide a real denominator by zero hits, so a blank-text test keeps them. `format_table` also located the platoon table's second Pitch Type column at a hardcoded index 9 behind an `ncol >= 16` gate; it now finds it by name, because dropping columns shrinks both halves.
- Report Total rows RECOMPUTE every rate over the whole outing; never average the per-type rows, which would weight an 11-pitch type the same as a 27-pitch one. Only Count, % Thrown, release point (Ext/RelZ/RelX/Arm Angle), Stuff+ and the outcome rates aggregate; velocity, max velo, spin, tilt, IVB/HB and VAA/HAA stay blank because a mean across pitch types is not a pitch anyone threw. Do NOT point `Daily.R` at `summarize_total_row`: Daily carries a Stuff+ column the shared helper does not model, and it formats arm angle `%.1f` where the shared reports use `%.1f°`.
- A postponed game is `abstractGameState: Final` with `codedGameState: D` on its ORIGINAL date, and the makeup game reuses the gamePk. Gate schedule pulls on `codedGameState == 'F'` (`_game_is_completed` in `pipeline/fetch.py`) and never let an empty boxscore claim a gamePk, or the dedup drops the real game. Six makeup games and 150 players were short one game until 2026-08-23.
- The v1 Stuff+ LOSO gate (`scripts/research/stuff/stuff_pertype_loso_gate.py`, `stuff_features_loso.py`) applies the nVAA transform on the pitch dicts and then `build_df` applies the frozen `NVAA_SLOPES` again. Every gate run after v12 shipped scored a double-adjusted VAA. Use `stuff_gate_v2.py`, which adjusts VAA once from `vaa_raw`.
- A Stuff+ feature or hyperparameter decision needs the NEXT-SEASON objective (`nxt_r` in `stuff_gate_v2.py`, year Y grade against Y+1 outcomes, model fit on neither) with a paired bootstrap SE. The within-season `fut_r` passed depth 7 and failed to detect a +0.015 gain from pitcher height; `nxt_r` found both. Wins in 5/5 pairs on a delta inside one SE is not a result.
- `scripts/builders/build_historical_training_set.py` imports `scripts.build_2025_training_set`, a pre-reorg path. It does not import. Copy `GUTS` or fix the import before relying on it.
- Never push to main while an update-leaderboard run is in flight. The run rebases before its artifact push; a push that moved `catch.html`/`index.html` stamps makes that rebase conflict (UU), the run FAILS at the commit step, and its entire output — leaderboard data AND, on retrains, the published bundle asset — is dropped. On 2026-08-23 the v14 retrain lost ~50 minutes this way. Dispatch, then freeze main until green.
- Pitcher K%/BB%/K-BB% divide by the OFFICIAL boxscore TBF, never the pitch-derived `pa`. A no-pitch intentional walk (automatic since 2017) leaves no pitch row, so `pa` runs short by that many batters faced and K% reads high. `js/aggregator.js` must re-apply the shipped season rate whenever the aggregation covered the whole season (gate on `rows[i].pa === pre.pa`), because `DataStore.getFilteredDataV2` calls `needsReaggregation()`, which returns `true` unconditionally: a server-only fix does not change a single number on the leaderboard. The player page reads `PITCHER_DATA` directly and needs no client fix.
- Pitcher BB% is UNINTENTIONAL walks over TBF; hitter BB% is TOTAL walks (incl. IBB) over PA. FanGraphs counts IBB for both, so its pitcher BB% reads higher than ours by design. Do not "fix" that gap.
- No-pitch intentional walks are ALREADY in the sheets as marker rows (`PitchID` ends `_00`, Event `Intent Walk`, every measurement blank). `read_all_pitches_from_sheets` drops them at the boundary via `real_pitches`/`is_no_pitch`; PA-level callers pass `include_no_pitch=True`. Do NOT teach the per-pitch denominators to skip them instead: that was tried on 2026-08-18 and did not converge (`c[0] += 1` in four micro loops, `usagePct`, and a `not in BALL_DESCRIPTIONS` numerator that scored a no-pitch row as a STRIKE). Because the pipeline excludes them, pitch-derived `pa` is short by design, which is why the PA-denominated rates read official boxscore counts. Keep the marker set current with `scripts/audits/enumerate_missing_ibb.py` then `scripts/ops/write_missing_ibb.py --apply`.
- Exactly ONE row per at-bat may carry a plate-appearance Event. A live scrape stamps the outcome on the then-final pitch; the re-pull appends the real final pitch and the PitchID dedupe cannot tell the earlier row is now wrong, so both keep it. The stale row also carries `BBType` and the batted-ball columns, so one ball in play is counted twice (BABIP, GB%/FB%/PU%, hard-hit, avg EV). `process_data` warns right after the Sheets read via `duplicate_pa_events`; repair with `scripts/ops/fix_duplicate_pa_events.py --apply`. It clears `PA_OUTCOME_COLUMNS` only. Never clear `Description`, `Count`, `Runners`, `Outs` or `RunExp` on those rows: the stale row is a real pitch and those are per-pitch facts.
- PlateX/PlateZ are Savant-denominated since 2026-08-29. The gameday feed serves pZ ~+0.08 ft above Savant's plate_z (SzTop/SzBot and PlateX agree), which flipped borderline low pitches into the zone. `backfill_supplement.py` always-overwrites both columns from Savant on MLB AND ROC/AAA tabs (the minors feed carries the same +0.086 ft bias, measured 2026-08-30). The SCRAPE also merges them now, from the `gf` endpoint, which is fully populated one minute after a game goes Final while the Statcast Search CSV is still empty; it fails open, keeping the feed value and logging the count. `scripts/audits/resync_recent_platez.py` is RETIRED — it syncs toward the feed and would undo the backfill.
- The Savant `gf` endpoint reliably serves exactly TWO things the scrape uses: `plate_x`/`plate_z` (validated 281/281 exact vs the search CSV) and `batSpeed` (49/49 exact vs backfilled values). It does NOT carry SwingLength/AttackAngle/AttackDirection/SwingPathTilt at all, and its `runnerOn1B/2B/3B`, `xba` and `is_barrel` lookalikes FAIL validation (Runners 105/130, xBA 2/26, and is_barrel is a 0/1 flag where the sheet stores the 1-6 launch_speed_angle). Measured 2026-08-30. Those columns come from `backfill_supplement` only; do not wire them from `gf`.
- ROC/AAA `fip` and `xFIP` come from FanGraphs' MINOR-LEAGUE endpoint (`fetch_aaa_pitchers`), not the pipeline's own formula. The pipeline applies the MLB FIP constant (3.084) and the MLB league HR/FB rate to AAA components, which measured FIP +0.426 too low (sd 0.003 across 29 arms matched on identical IP, i.e. a pure constant) and xFIP +0.577 too low; the implied FanGraphs AAA constant is 3.510. That value was comparable to NEITHER league. FanGraphs publishes no minor-league SIERA, so a ROC `siera` STILL carries that bias — never read one as an International League number.
- A metric's prose definition has THREE homes: the module docstring, the card footnote in `cards/pitcher.py`, and the `desc` string in `js/leaderboard.js`. The hpERA channel-set correction of 2026-08-27 reached `pipeline/eraplus.py` and the js tooltip but not the card, which then told every reader that hpERA contains hdERA's xwOBA term and that both are calibrated to future ERA. Both were false. After changing what a metric IS, grep its name across all three homes.
- A card footnote that names columns must read the same config the columns do. The RV note hardcoded `PitchRV/100` while `--rv-mode totals` renamed the columns to `PitchRV`, so the note described absent columns in the wrong unit.
- `_sheet_row` in the pitch cache goes stale, because rows shift. Any tool that WRITES to a sheet row must re-read the cell and confirm the `PitchID` first, then look the row up by `PitchID` if it does not match. Measured 2026-08-26: one of three target rows had moved by 129 rows.
- A recalibration of any Stuff+ input column owes a RETRAIN, not a score-only run. nVAA reads PlateZ (`train_stuff.py:304`), and the 2026-08-29 Savant recalibration moved every 2026 nVAA by ~0.09 deg (0.2 between-pitcher SD on FF/SI/FC/CH) under fold models trained on feed values; no retrain followed until at least 2026-09-02. Read retrain dates from `gh run list` durations (~50 min vs ~15): `stuff_metrics_history.csv` appends on every score-only run and cannot tell you.
- CI commits `data/ index.html trade.html catch.html css/ js/` only. `stuff_plus/pitcher_stuff.csv`, the low-support flag source that score-only runs read, never leaves the runner, so the site carries the flags from the last LOCAL commit of that file (2026-08-13 as of 2026-09-02; the v14.1 height-tail rule never reached the site).
- Bump the bundle `version` string on ANY change that alters scoring. v14.1 (the height clip) kept `'v14'`, so the card and score-only guards accept the pre-clip local bundle as current.
- Any 2026-side Loc+ verdict dated before 2026-08-29 ran on feed PlateZ, +0.086 ft = 0.054 znorm = 54% of `BIN_Z` above the Savant-denominated 2021-2025 caches. A/B arms shared the shift, so those verdicts stand; absolute vertical-geometry claims (grid alignment, the per-type gates) do not, and the gates have not been re-measured.
- Every Loc+ `K_*` is in KERNEL-WEIGHTED units: `_smooth` adds the pseudo-count to a kernel-weighted denominator, so a bandwidth change silently changes every K's strength. Sweep K and bandwidth jointly, or re-express K in raw counts first.
- The Loc+ replicate harness (`locplus_constants_multiseason.py` and everything that imports it) builds predictive surfaces on a QUARTER season and reliability surfaces on a HALF; production builds on a full season. Its smoothing and shrinkage verdicts lean toward more regularization than production needs, the same trap as the 2026-08-16 cell-k note. Its `raw` objective is the luck-neutral xRV hybrid, not actual RV, whatever the comments say.
- `data/_gate_v2/results.json` never existed on disk; the Stuff+ gate's records are `run_*.log` plus the agg pickles, and `height_map()` needs `data/_gate_v2/pitcher_height.json`, which is gone. Rebuild both, and `season_2026.pkl` (frozen 2026-08-22, feed PlateZ), before any re-gate.
- Five Loc+ research scorers (`countwhiff_multiseason`, `countcompose_multiseason`, `countphys_extension`, `structure_multiseason`, `bw_prototype`) index `S['WH'][key][i][j]`; the live shape is `S['WH'][key][count]` since 2026-08-15, and `locplus_final_gate.py` imports them. A "reproduce with" docstring in that set is dead until they are patched.
- The out-of-sample CELL-fit objective decides a cell TABLE's shrinkage (CT+/SD+/xwOBA3D), not Loc+'s smoothing bandwidth. Measured 2026-09-02 on full seasons: cell fit prefers 2 in / 0.12 on every surface (30/30 pairs) while the pitcher-level objective loses 0/6 there and RISES toward 6-13 in / 0.30-0.40. For a pitcher grade the pitcher-level objective decides; run both and say which one you are reading.
- Build Loc+ research surfaces on the FULL season (`locplus_fullseason_replicate.py`), not a quarter. The BIN_Z offset and width-0.11 "5/5, t 4-5" wins vanished at production sample size (3/6, inside one SE), and the August three-config bandwidth gate reversed direction.
- `zsh` does not word-split an unquoted `$ARGS`: `python3 script.py $ARGS` passes one argument. Use `${=ARGS}` or an array, and check the log head before waiting on a launch.
- Expected movement (`pipeline/xmove.py`) is scored PER PITCH and the site and card only sum `sumXIVB`/`sumXHB` from the micro rows; never put model math back into `js/aggregator.js`. The shipped basis is the HITTER one (slot, extension, velocity): the spin + release-axis basis explains movement far better (R² 0.49 vs 0.27) but its residual explains RESULTS worse than raw movement, because it credits away the spin that is the weapon (`xmove_residual_value.py`, 5-season LOSO). It shipped for four hours on 2026-09-03 and was pulled. Its harmonic columns are also near-collinear in narrow-tilt groups, so if it ever returns, sweep `XMOVE_RIDGE` and `XMOVE_MIN_N` jointly.
- A background wait loop of the form `until ! pgrep -f "<name>"` never exits when `<name>` appears in the loop's own command line: `pgrep -f` matches the shell running the loop. On 2026-09-03 that held a push for 15 minutes after the pipeline had finished. Wait on a pid, a done-marker file, or `gh run view`, never on a pattern that names the thing you are typing.
- `TEAM_ABBREV_TO_ID` in `cards/pitcher.py` carries `ROC` as a WSH alias for the player search, so `team in TEAM_ABBREV_TO_ID` is NOT an MLB test. Split levels with `pipeline.utils.AAA_TEAMS`. On 2026-09-05 the level test counted Rochester as an MLB stint and the merged season baseline silently dropped every ROC row for anyone with a 2TM row.
- The Stuff+ gate's `nxt_r` POOLS hands. A feature that shifts one hand's level (`is_lhp`: +0.040 pooled, z 4.9, 5/5) wins the gate while ranking no one better within a hand (-0.001). Decompose within group before reading any gate win as a ranking gain. Measured 2026-09-05.
- The ERA replicate inputs (`data/_era_targets.json`, `_era_battery.json`, `_era_internal_cmdloc.json`, `_era_xrv100.json`, `_era_internal_stuff.json`, `_era_ages.json`) are scratch and were lost once. Rebuild in this order: `scripts/research/era/era_targets_build.py` (MLB Stats API), `era_battery_build.py`, `era_cmd_loc_scores.py`, `era_xrv100_pass.py`, `era_stuff_loso_v2.py`. Do not use `era_stuff_loso_scores.py`: its v1 import chain (`stuff_features_loso` -> `stuff_feature_battery_2026_08` -> `scripts.build_historical_training_set`) no longer resolves. `era_park_weight_refit.py` also loads a lost file (`_era_team_outs.json`) at import.
- The ERA harness negates the xRV channel (`era_weights_final.raw_features`, comment says "pitcher-positive -> ERA dir") but `era_xrv100_pass.py` stores batter-positive values, so a harness xrv weight reads with the OPPOSITE sign to production `W_PH['xrv']`. Compare magnitudes only.
- FIP's components divide by INNINGS, not by nine: `(13 HR + 3 (BB + HBP) - 2 K) / IP + cFIP`. A per-nine conversion (`x 27 / outs`) makes FIP nine times too wide and the constant hides it (league mean still matches). On 2026-09-05 that read as an 8x park slope before it was caught.
- Savant's published runs park factor is shrunk: actual runs allowed move 1.67x it (LOSO, 2021-2026, innings-weighted). "Full park adjustment" and "the published factor" are not the same thing; say which one a constant is measured against. Measure a pass-through WITHIN player (home minus road on the same player): the across-player club-exposure design puts club quality on the park axis and read hdERA's share as .91 (2026-09-05) where the within design reads .67, and read the hitters' xwOBA share as negative where it is .35.
- Do not refit a VALUE metric's runs scale on the same-season slope of actual runs on the deserved rate. Selection on outcomes bends that slope (2026-09-05: 1.33 for arms under 60 IP, 0.76 above 120, 0.86 pooled) and it is not over-dispersion. hdERA's DH_B stays the LOSO slope on the 30-IP pool.
- Savant `delta_run_exp` (the sheet's `RunExp`) prices a double play like ONE out: a GIDP reads -.33 against -.30 for a force out at 0 outs, 2021-2025, and the sheet's PA-ending pitch inherits it. Never use it for double-play or other second-out run values; `pipeline/hwar.py` prices them from the 24-state table. Its per-event means otherwise track linear weights (HR -1.52, K +.22).
- Barrel takes a hand-entered `Yes`/`No` as well as the 1-6 `launch_speed_angle` code (research.mlb.com reports a flag, not the code; the IDK tab carries it). Read the column ONLY through `pipeline.utils.barrel_flag` (True / False / None for absent). `Yes` counts as 6; `No` is a real observation and must never fall back to the EV/LA recompute, which only fires on None; `sheet_precision.domain_problem` admits both words. Eight `== '6'` sites went through the helper on 2026-09-07, and it is identical to the old tests on every value in the live sheets (664,873 cached pitches, only '' and 1-6).
- The feed's `pX`/`pZ` are the 9P trajectory evaluated at the FRONT of the plate (y = 17/12 ft; RMS 0.0003 ft on 532 pitches). Savant's `plate_x`/`plate_z`, and its `zone` field that InZone was validated against, are the same trajectory at the plate MIDPOINT (y = 8.5/12 ft; RMS 0.0000). The documented "+0.086 ft feed bias" is therefore `0.7083 × tan(VAA)`, half the plate depth, and it is NOT a constant: 0.057 ft on FF, 0.085 SI, 0.097 SL, 0.123 CU (measured 2026-09-07). Never subtract a flat 0.086 to convert planes; use the per-pitch VAA, or per-type means and say so. Same InZone rule on the two planes disagrees on 5.3% of MLB pitches, net +2.6 Zone% points on the front plane, three-quarters of them low pitches called in.
- The R movement plot takes pitcher handedness from `Throws`, never from the sign of `RelPosX`. The sign test disagrees with `Throws` for 5 of 922 cached pitchers (crossfire releases and one exact-zero mean that fails `< 0`) and returns NA on hand-entered rows with no release data, where its default sent a right-hander's arm-angle rays into the LHP quadrant (Susana, 2026-09-07). `RelPosX` remains only as a fallback for a frame with no `Throws` column.
- `compute_xrv` prices a ball in play from `xwOBA` and everything else from `RunExp`; when a row set has NEITHER it falls through to the league-mean BIP value by count, so the total is a handful of league averages over N pitches and says nothing about the arm (Susana scratch card 2026-09-07: 24 BIP over 259 pitches read -0.4/100 at the 40th percentile). Gate xRV, and Pitcher+ which consumes it, on the presence of a run-value source; the scratch card context does. `pitcherplus.score_row` scores whatever channels exist, so a row missing Stuff+ still returns a number that is not Pitcher+.
- Scratch-tab MiLB season cards take FIP and xFIP from `fg_overrides.fetch_milb_pitcher_line` (FanGraphs minors, IP-weighted across levels; the IP-weighted mean of the per-level rows reproduces FanGraphs' own MiLB line to the second decimal) and show xFIP in SIERA's slot. The box-derived trio uses the MLB constants, which are +0.43 FIP low at AAA and unmeasured at A+/AA, and FanGraphs publishes no minor-league SIERA. The metadata carries no league xFIP; the card builds the tint anchor count-weighted from MLB leaderboard rows (`_league_xfip_anchor`), the pipeline's own rule for `fip`.
