    MERGED ACROSS LEVELS per pitch type (2026-09-05, per Wally): a pitcher

    that type at both levels. Before this the largest single row set won
    outright, which scored Cruz's ROC fastball against his MLB 99.8 (his ROC
    mean is 97.8) and left any type thrown at only the other level with no
    baseline at all (Kent SI, Varland CU, Schultz ST rendered unshaded).

    The MLB side is the combined nTM row when one exists, because that row
    already sums the club stints; otherwise every single-club MLB row. The
    minor side is every non-MLB row. Means are count-weighted, run-value
    totals sum, maxVelo takes the max, usagePct is re-derived as the type's
    share of the merged pitch total, and a percentile (pool-relative, so not
    mergeable) rides along from the largest contributing row.

    Caveat: if the pipeline has already run today, the season row INCLUDES

# Replaces the retired 0.72/0.28 Stuff+/Loc+ season blend as the meaning of
# "Pitching+": one 100±10 number for how well the pitcher pitched THIS
# outing. Composite of the outing's Stuff+ atoms, Loc+ atoms, CSW% and
# xRV/100, each z-scored against this season's league pool of single MLB
# outings and shrunk by its measured outing-grain stabilization constant.

# Weights are FROZEN from the 2021-2025 odd/even-PA split-half search
# (scripts/research/stuff/pitcherplus_outing_grade.py + _pick.py: fit
# components on one half of an outing to the xRV/100 of the other half,
# OOF by season; the chosen set sits in a flat top region and beat a
# stuff-only grade in 5/5 seasons, and in the never-fitted 2026 sheets
# replicate, r .109 vs .087). k are the measured outing-grain stabilization
# constants for loc/csw/xrv.
# RE-TESTED 2026-09-02 WITH TRUE PER-HALF STUFF ATOMS (the original search
# reused the full-game stuff value on both halves; pitcherplus_outing_refit.py,
# data/_pplus_outing_refit_2026_09.md): the frozen weights still win (pooled
# r .0788 vs .0779 for the out-of-fold refit at k 42; the leaked stuff weight
# was high by 1.3 SE, .205 vs .165), the PAIRED 1-SE rule now selects this
# 4-term set, and the composite objective is FLAT in stuff k from ~20 to
# ~150 (peak 30-50). Stuff's outing-grain reliability crossing is only 5,
# but shrinkage here acts as an n-weighting device (the slope of unshrunk
# stuff on the other half grows .15 -> .39 from 20-pitch to 80-pitch
# outings), so 42 is a CONVENTION inside the flat region, not a reliability
# constant. xRV rides the sheet supplement, so a card built before the
# morning backfill drifts ~0.5 pts (p95 1.5) and self-corrects.

    Looks each requested pitcher up in the season pitcher leaderboard and returns

    A pitcher with MLB stints on more than one team resolves to all of those
    tabs with a 2TM/3TM label (matching the pipeline's combined leaderboard row),
    so a traded arm's full season is stitched together automatically. A pitcher
    with a single MLB stint resolves to that team; an arm with no MLB rows (e.g.
    AAA-only) resolves to its non-MLB tab(s). Aggregate 2TM/3TM pseudo-teams are
    never read directly (they are not real worksheets).

    include_non_mlb=True (the --all-levels flag) also folds a pitcher's AAA (and
    any other non-MLB) stints into the combine, so an arm that split the year
    between MLB and AAA gets ONE cross-level card. Such an arm is labeled
