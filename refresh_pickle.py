"""refresh_pickle.py — fast refresh of data/all_pitches_rs_cache.pkl.

Why this exists
---------------
The full Huronalytics pipeline (process_data.py) runs on CI and writes
two outputs:

  1. data/hitter_leaderboard_rs.json (and friends) — committed to git,
     pulled to your laptop every time you `git pull`.
  2. data/all_pitches_rs_cache.pkl                — gitignored (~100 MB,
     too big), stays on the CI server, NEVER reaches your laptop.

HitterCards.py reads BOTH. When the JSON is fresh (today) but the pickle
is stale (last local pipeline run), the per-pitch heat maps and LA × Spray
scatter plot a stale snapshot while the aggregate stats show fresh
numbers. Confusing.

refresh_pickle.py rebuilds JUST the pickle by re-reading Google Sheets
and applying the same pre-pickle cleanup that process_data.py does.
Everything downstream of the pickle (stats / percentiles / JSON writes)
is skipped, so this runs in ~1-2 minutes instead of ~5-10.

Usage
-----
    python3 refresh_pickle.py

Requires the same Google Sheets credentials process_data.py uses
(~/.config/gspread, GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON env var, or
service_account.json next to this script).
