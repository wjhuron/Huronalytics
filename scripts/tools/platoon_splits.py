"""platoon_splits.py — batter/pitcher handedness splits for a target player list.

Produces, for every player in TARGETS:
  hitters  : one row per split (All / vs RHP / vs LHP) per level
  pitchers : one row per split (All / vs RHH / vs LHH) per level
  arsenal  : one row per (pitch type x split) per level

Every metric that appears on the Huronalytics player cards and can be computed
from a pitch subset is included, plus a percentile rank against the MLB pool
evaluated on the SAME split.

Design decisions (see the README block the writer emits):

  1. League anchors stay FULL SEASON, MLB. Only the player's own pitch subset
     is split. So "SD+ vs LHP = 112" means 112 against the overall MLB average
     hitter, which makes vs-R and vs-L directly comparable to each other and to
     the season card. Splitting the baseline too would put each column in its
     own currency.

  2. Percentile pool = MLB players who qualify under the site's own rule
     (3.1 PA x team games for hitters; 1.0 IP x TG for SP / 0.5 for RP),
     evaluated on the same split. Pool size is reported per metric.

  3. ROC / AAA players are ranked RAW against the MLB distribution with no
     level translation, exactly as the site and the cards do.
