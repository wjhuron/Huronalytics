"""platoon_cards.py — one player card per handedness split.

Renders the SAME visuals as the season cards (HitterCards / Cards), but with
every number, grade and percentile bubble computed from one side of the platoon
split only.

The percentile question is the one that matters. A vs-LHP xwOBAcon is ranked
against other MLB hitters' vs-LHP xwOBAcon, not against their season numbers:
same-hand and opposite-hand distributions sit in different places, so a season
pool would systematically flatter the opposite-hand cards and punish the
same-hand ones. Pools come from scripts/tools/platoon_splits.py, which is validated
against the shipped leaderboard.

League ANCHORS stay full-season and MLB (SD+/CT+ cell tables, BB+ denominator,
Process+ standardization, SACQ zones, xRV count offsets). Only the player's own
pitches are split, so the two cards are on one scale and comparable to the
season card they came from.

Level handling, per Wally:
  - ROC hitters and the four ROC arms: their own level only.
  - Bird / Dion / Cruz: MLB and minor league pitches COMBINED into one card
    per hand, since the question is what the whole arm has done vs that side.
  - Ortiz: ROC only, his 5 MLB PA excluded.

Usage:  python3 scripts/tools/platoon_cards.py [--role hitters|pitchers|both]

    the distribution and drifts at the tails, which is exactly where a platoon
