"""Regenerate micro_data_rs.json with CURRENT grade-atom dumps.

process_data.py builds micro data mid-run, when the Stuff+ dump on disk is
still the PREVIOUS train_stuff_v11 run's — so games newer than that run
would carry no stuff atoms in the embedded micro data (filtered site views
would silently omit them from windowed Stuff+/Pitching+). This script runs
AFTER train_stuff_v11 --dump-pitch-grades and rebuilds micro data from the
pitch cache (written by process_data at the exact point micro generation
reads it, so inputs are bit-identical) with both dumps fresh.

Pipeline order: process_data.py -> train_stuff_v11 --score-only --inject
--dump-pitch-grades -> refresh_micro_grades.py -> rebuild_embed.py
