"""augment_priors_spinaxis.py — add SpinAxis to the 2021-24 training pickles.

The AXIS feature (OTilt-RTilt deviation) needs spin_axis on the prior rows;
the pickles were built without it. Rebuilding from scratch would lose the
weather-adjusted movement, so instead: re-run build_season_dicts with a
SpinAxis passthrough (in-memory source patch), VERIFY row-for-row alignment
with the existing pickle (length + sampled Velocity/Pitcher/Pitch Type
equality), then inject SpinAxis positionally into the existing rows.

2025's pickle comes from the sheets-statcast join (different builder, no
positional alignment available) — its rows keep SpinAxis=None; AXIS trains
on 2021-24 (2.8M rows) + 2026 (RTilt on every sheet row). OTilt needs no
augmentation anywhere: it derives from raw movement already in the rows.
