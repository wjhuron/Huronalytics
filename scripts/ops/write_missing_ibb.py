"""write_missing_ibb.py — append no-pitch intentional-walk marker rows to the
division workbooks. Step 2 of the backfill that enumerate_missing_ibb.py
starts.

Since 2017 an automatic intentional walk contains no pitches, so it cannot
appear in pitch-level data on its own. The sheets record each one as a MARKER
row: PitchID ends `_00`, Event is 'Intent Walk', the identity columns are
filled and every pitch measurement is blank. `pipeline.utils.is_no_pitch`
recognises the row and `read_all_pitches_from_sheets` drops it by default, so
the marker completes the source of truth without moving a single per-pitch
denominator. Only PA-level callers opt in with include_no_pitch=True.

The first sweep ran 2026-08-18 and wrote 320 rows. This script is what keeps
the set current: run the enumerator, then run this, and only the games since
the last sweep are appended.

Ten columns carry a value, matching the 320 rows already in the sheets
exactly (verified field by field, 2026-08-26):

    Game Date, PTeam, Pitcher, Throws, BTeam, Batter, Bats, Outs,
    Event, PitchID

Everything else stays blank on purpose. `pipeline.fetch` turns a blank into
None, which is what keeps these rows out of the batted-ball and zone filters.
Runners is blank too: it comes from the Statcast supplement in the normal
path, and no supplement row exists for a pitch that was never thrown.

Rows are routed to the PITCHER's tab, because that is where the scraper puts
every other row for that pitcher.

Safety: the write goes through scrapers.sheets_append.push_team_data, which
refuses to append when the tab header does not match the frame (positional
append, so a mismatch would corrupt every row), and which drops any PitchID
already present. Re-running this is therefore a no-op, not a duplicate.

    python3 scripts/ops/write_missing_ibb.py            # DRY RUN, writes nothing
