"""Build a full leaderboard for ONE date window, using the season code path.

Why this exists
---------------
A hitter card for a date window cannot read the season leaderboard row, and it
cannot honestly draw percentile bubbles either: a percentile needs an all-MLB
pool measured over the SAME window. This script produces that pool.

It does NOT reimplement any of the metric math. It filters the Sheets pitches
by date and hands them to `pipeline.process_data.process_game_type`, the same
function the shipped build calls. Everything downstream of that call is
therefore identical by construction to a season run:

  * the boxscore merge, whose dates are derived from the pitches passed in, so
    PA / AVG / OBP / SLG / wOBA come from the window's own official boxscores
  * every league average, weighted the same way
  * the SD+ and CT+ cell weight tables, rebuilt over the window
  * the BB+ league xwOBAcon anchor
  * the Process+ composite, its standardization, and the plus re-anchor
  * every percentile pool

`window_mode=True` suppresses only the three merges that reach OUTSIDE the
pitch set for season-scoped numbers: Savant sprint speed and the two
FanGraphs overrides. FanGraphs itself DOES serve custom date ranges; it is
our fg_overrides cache that is season-scoped, so there are no window-matched
FG values to apply. See the docstring on process_game_type.

Output
------
data/_window_<slug>_hitter_leaderboard.json  (scratch, underscore-prefixed)
data/_window_<slug>_metadata.json
data/_window_index.json                      (slug -> window bounds + counts)

Nothing here can reach the site. The shipped `_rs` artifacts are never
written, the gzipped embeds are never rebuilt, and the asset version is never
bumped.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/builders/build_window_leaderboard.py START END [--cached]

    # any range works; the pool is always measured over exactly that range
    python3 scripts/builders/build_window_leaderboard.py 2026-05-01 2026-06-15
    python3 scripts/builders/build_window_leaderboard.py 2026-07-16 2026-08-17 --cached

Budget about 8 minutes per window: roughly 2m30s to read the six division
workbooks, then the build itself.

--cached reuses data/_window_pitches_cache.pkl, the frozen Sheets read from a
previous run, and skips the 2m30s read. The cache records the date it was
taken. Use it when you are sweeping several ranges in one sitting; drop it
when the Sheets have been appended to since, because Sheets is the source of
truth and the cache is only a copy of it.
