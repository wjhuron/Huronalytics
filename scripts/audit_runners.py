"""audit_runners.py — audit the Runners column across all 32 tabs (30 MLB +
ROC + AAA) against the feed's per-pitch base state. READ-ONLY.

MLB Runners comes from the Savant supplement (on_1b/2b/3b per pitch); ROC/AAA was
just backfilled from the feed. This re-derives per-pitch base state from the feed
(pre-PA state carried across plays + mid-PA runner movements — the logic verified
157/157 on 822757 incl. a steal) and flags any stored value that disagrees,
highlighting PAs where the base state changed mid-PA (steal/pickoff/etc.).
