"""
Per-column decimal depth for the Google Sheet columns, and the one formatter.

Single home for the precision policy. `backfill_supplement.py` and
`backfill_full.py` both write the same columns, so a depth that lived in two
places would have them overwrite each other's cells on every run: one writes
53.6, the other writes 53.600, and each sees the other's value as a change
forever. (The retired PITCHING_W_STUFF constant once ran 70/30 in one file
and 80/20 in another for about three weeks — same failure shape.)

Depths were measured 2026-08-17 by reading every field of 5 MLB feed games and
one Savant day as raw text, before any float parsing. That split the columns in
two:

CLASS 1, the source is genuinely quantized. The depth here IS the source depth
and there is nothing to decide.
    Velocity, IndVertBrk, HorzBrk, ExitVelo, ArmAngle, BatSpeed               1
    SwingLength                                                               2
    LaunchAngle, Distance                                                     1
    HC_X, HC_Y                                                                2
    xBA, xSLG, xwOBA, RunExp                                                  3
    Spin Rate, Outs, Barrel                                                   0
LaunchAngle and Distance were being cast to integers, so they gain a digit that
the feed was always sending.

CLASS 2, the source is a raw IEEE-754 double. The feed and Savant report 12 to
20 decimals of binary expansion, which is not measurement. There is no objective
that could pick a depth here, so these are a CONVENTION, not a measured optimum,
and they are labelled as such per the tuning rule in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.
Wally set them 2026-08-17: 4 decimals for feet, 3 for degrees. Reasoning on
record: 0.0001 ft is 0.0012 inch and Hawkeye resolves to roughly 0.1 inch, so 4
decimals keeps every real digit with about 100x margin, and digit 5 onward is
noise.
    PlateZ, PlateX, RelPosZ, RelPosX, Extension, SzTop, SzBot                 4
    VAA, HAA, AttackAngle, AttackDirection, SwingPathTilt                     3

xIndVrtBrk and xHorzBrk stay at 1 decimal by instruction. They are IndVertBrk
times a weather factor, and IndVertBrk itself carries only 1 decimal.

RTilt and OTilt are Sheets time values rendered h:mm and are deliberately absent
from PRECISION. Wally's call 2026-08-17: leave the representation alone.
