"""
Full-column backfill: reconcile every Google Sheet column against its source.

`backfill_supplement.py` fills the 12 Savant-served columns and nothing else.
This module reconciles all 43 in-scope columns, 31 of which come from the MLB
Stats API game feed and have never been backfillable. It also adds the two
things the supplement path cannot do: it finds pitches that are missing from the
sheet entirely, and it rewrites stored values at full source precision.

Out of scope by instruction (Wally, 2026-08-17): Game Date, PTeam, BTeam,
PitchID, Pitch Type, Stuff+, Loc+.

DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. Nothing is written to any sheet without --apply.

    python3 -m scrapers.backfill_full                    # dry run, whole season
    python3 -m scrapers.backfill_full --teams ARI,WSH    # dry run, two tabs
    python3 -m scrapers.backfill_full --apply            # write

Design notes that are not obvious:

  * The feed is parsed by Pitcher2026.download_game_data, not by a second copy
    of the parser here. It is called with raw_precision=True and a disk-cached
    payload. One parser means the backfill can never disagree with the scraper
    that wrote the row in the first place.

  * "Precision" changes and "drift" changes are separated, because they need
    different review. A cell is a precision change only when the stored value is
    exactly what you get by rounding today's source value to the stored value's
    own decimal depth. Anything else is real movement in the source.

  * Blank cells are not all the same thing. Wally deliberately deleted a small
    number of Velocity, Spin Rate, RTilt and movement values that were obvious
    misreads (a 55 mph slip, a 200 rpm curveball). Refilling those with the same
    number would undo the decision, so a blank-fill candidate is suppressed when
    the source still offers the value that was rejected. See DecisionLedger.

# ── Position players (EP) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EP is the eephus, and in this sheet it is a clean marker for a position player
# on the mound. Measured 2026-08-17: 1,746 EP pitches from 52 pitchers, and for
# every one of the 52 the EP count equals his TOTAL pitch count, so not one of
# them is a real pitcher with an eephus in his arsenal.
#
# Wally's call 2026-08-17: do not touch the pitch-characteristic columns on these
# rows. Release, movement, spin and approach are not meaningful for a shortstop
# lobbing one in, and a measured value there is noise dressed as data.
#
# Everything else on an EP row IS kept and reviewed: Count, Description, Event,
# and the whole batted-ball block. An EP pitch still has a real count, a real
# result and a real batted ball, and one of ARI's Count corrections sits on one.
#
# PlateZ, PlateX, SzTop and SzBot are deliberately NOT in this set. Location is
# measured the same way whoever throws the pitch, and the zone belongs to the
# hitter, not the pitcher. VAA and HAA ARE in it, because they are derived from
# velocity and movement and inherit their meaninglessness here.

# thrown, and nothing else in the schema does.
#
#   1. They are skipped entirely on EP rows. Release, movement, spin and approach
#      are not meaningful for a shortstop lobbing one in.
#   2. They are the only columns a recommendation may judge against the pitcher's
#      own median for a pitch type. Everything else is per-event or belongs to the
#      batter, so his median says nothing about it — see recommend().
#
# Deliberately absent: PlateZ and PlateX, because a pitcher throws all over the

# needs a per-column yardstick, and the natural one is the column's own spread
# within a (pitcher, pitch type) group. A 10 rpm move is 0.11 of that spread; a
# 760 rpm move is 8.5 of it. Absolute thresholds cannot do that job, because
# 10 rpm and 10 mph are not remotely the same size of claim.
#
# Robust scale (MAD x 1.4826) so the misreads we are hunting do not inflate the

# sample size production runs at, using groups of 30 pitches or more.

# A pitcher's own band: the quantile of his deviations from his centre, for one
# pitch type, that a proposed value must stay inside.
#
# This replaced an "added distance" test that was too aggressive and that Wally
# caught on 2026-08-17. Bryan Abreu's fastball tilt read 12:54, the feed proposed
# 12:42, and his average is 1:00. The old rule rejected it because the change
# moved the value from 6 minutes off his average to 18. But 18 minutes is 9
# degrees of spin axis and his own band is 20 minutes, so that is an entirely
# ordinary place for one pitch to land. Distance from the average is not evidence
# of error until it leaves the range the pitcher actually occupies, and only his
# own observed spread can say where that is.
#
# 0.99 rather than the maximum is a CONVENTION, and the reasoning is that the
# maximum is fragile: one bad value already sitting in the sheet for that pitcher
# and pitch type inflates it and the test stops rejecting anything. Measured on
# HOU's 105 candidate rows the two differ on 6, and in all 6 the maximum is the
# permissive one. BAND_MIN_N of 20 is the floor for trusting a quantile at all;

# 99.85% sit below 1.0 and the sweep gives 91 review rows at 0.5, 26 at 1.0, 10

#
# Measured coverage of today's blanks on rows that do have tracking:
#   Velocity   22 blank, 17 with a record (3 held a value on Jul 6)
#   Spin Rate  2,782 blank, 1,239 with a record (56 held a value on Jul 6)
#   RTilt      1,139 blank, 1,118 with a record
#
# The snapshot cannot prove a blank was a deletion rather than a feed gap, and
# it does not need to. The test is not "was this deleted", it is "is the number
# on offer today the number that was already rejected". Exact match only —
# Wally's call 2026-08-17: no tolerance band, any difference gets reviewed.

# record of a manual decision. At the end of every sweep each reviewable and
# each held-back change is written into it. The next sweep compares its proposal
# against that record: the same value is skipped, a different value is surfaced.
# Nothing has to be marked up by hand.
#
# The bootstrap entries from the 2026-07-06 snapshots live in the same store and

# has been seen before.

# relative to THIS pitcher's own median for THIS pitch type. That is what makes
# Kai-Wei Teng's sweeper reading IVB 18.6 against his own 1.0 obviously wrong,

# right, even though the second is the larger raw change.

    Wally's read (2026-08-17): the operator failed to change who was batting.
    Tested directly against all 91 season cells beyond ZONE_OUTLIER_FT, and it
    holds for 40 of the 51 at-bats: the odd zone equals the modal zone of
    another hitter who batted in that same game. Rocchio's at-bat 824408_027
    carries Trevor Larnach's zone, Ward's and Beavers' in 824168 carry Colton
    Cowser's, and Altuve's 824170_065 carries Isaac Paredes'.

    A cell is only rewritten when that match exists. The other 11 at-bats have a
    different signature and are reported instead of repaired: SzTop matches the
    hitter's own modal value EXACTLY and only SzBot moves, by roughly 0.4 inch.
    A mis-attributed batter would move both together, so these are something
    else — most likely a genuine re-measurement of the bottom of the zone, which
    a change in crouch would produce without moving shoulder height.

    Keyed on (Batter, BTeam), never on Batter alone, because two players share a
    name: Max Muncy reads 3.128/1.579 for LAD and 3.228/1.629 for ATH, and both
    are correct.

    The 9 unmatched at-bats are repaired as well, tagged `zone_fix_nodonor` and
    listed in their own tab. Wally's call 2026-08-17. Measured signature: SzTop
    is off by 0.00 inch in every one of the 9, and only SzBot moves, by 0.28 to
    0.47 inch. A mis-attributed batter moves both together, so the mechanism is
    different — but the alternate SzBot holds steady for the whole at-bat, which
    reads as an artifact rather than a genuine re-read of the knee. It is 17
    cells in 583,619, all under half an inch. Pass fix_nodonor=False to leave

  # still classified as drift and only then downgraded. Seventeen HOU cells were
