"""Command+ — per-pitch execution metric: miss distance from inferred intent.

Did he put the pitch where he meant to? Loc+ grades the VALUE of a location;
Command+ grades EXECUTION: the distance (inches) between where the pitch went
and the nearest of the pitcher's own inferred targets. The two are related
(r ~ 0.5-0.7) but distinct: target quality vs target attainment.

MODEL (research: scripts/research/commandplus/commandplus_v1.py + _battery + _bb_followup,
commit 5518ec4 — validated BEFORE this port existed, per the multi-season
standard):
  - cell = (pitcher, pitch type, batter hand, count group), count groups
      EVEN     0-0, 0-1, 1-1          (establish intent)
      PUTAWAY  any two-strike count   (bury / put-away intent)
      BEHIND   1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 2-1, 3-1 (must-strike intent)
  - a cell under MIN_CELL is NOT dropped: its pitches cascade into a
    (pitch type, batter hand) residual bucket, then a (pitch type) bucket,
    and a target is fit at whichever level first clears MIN_CELL. Only
    pitches from thin cells enter a bucket, so a target is always fit on
    exactly the pitches it scores. See the CASCADE finding below.
  - intended target = the MEAN of the cell's plate locations in PHYSICAL
    INCHES (one target per cell; see the K=1 finding below)
  - per-pitch miss = Euclidean inches to that target
  - pitcher raw = plain mean of his pitch misses (mean beat median on both
    reliability and persistence in all six seasons)
  - misses measured in fixed inches — never Mahalanobis with the pitcher's
    own covariance, which would divide out the very scatter being graded.
    That remains load-bearing.

K=1 — WHY THE GAUSSIAN MIXTURE WAS REMOVED (2026-08-12,
scripts/research/commandplus/commandplus_ladder_multiseason.py). v1 fit a 1-3 component GMM per
cell, K by BIC with sample caps. A four-rung ladder run over 2021-2026
(GLOBAL: one centroid, no cells / CELLMEAN: cells, K=1 / PROD: the v1 GMM /
KFREE: K up to 6, no caps), every rung scored on the same three objectives
and restricted to a COMMON pitcher pool, settled it:

                    reliability  persistence  BB% same  BB% next
    GLOBAL             0.789        0.703       0.511     0.401
    CELLMEAN (K=1)     0.812        0.791       0.565     0.440
    PROD (GMM)         0.799        0.786       0.555     0.432
    KFREE              0.774        0.778       0.547     0.430

The CELLS are load-bearing (GLOBAL -> CELLMEAN gains .088 persistence).
The MIXTURE is not: K=1 beat the GMM on 22 of 22 comparisons (6 seasons
reliability, 5 year-pairs persistence, 6 same-season BB%, 5 next-season
BB%) with no exceptions, and KFREE is worse still — a monotone gradient
that says BIC was selecting overfit components. The mixture captured
something real for a minority of genuinely two-target pitchers (Mahle, who
works two distinct fastball spots vs LHH, drops 124.5 -> 115.2) and
manufactured noise for the majority. r(GMM, K=1) = 0.990 on the displayed
scale, median move 0.7 points.

Removing it also retires the whole circularity apparatus — the separation
merge guard, the BIC selection, the K caps — since one target per cell
cannot split a wild pitcher's cloud into flattering sub-targets at all.

CASCADE — WHY THIN CELLS ARE POOLED RATHER THAN DROPPED (2026-08-12,
scripts/research/commandplus/commandplus_battery_2026_08.py section D and
scripts/research/commandplus/commandplus_volume_fallback.py). Dropping sub-MIN_CELL cells fell
hardest on secondary pitches (CU ~34% of pitches excluded for the thinnest
arms vs FF ~11%), so a low-volume pitcher was graded largely on his
best-commanded pitch. Cascading those pitches into coarser buckets instead:

                     coverage  reliability  persistence  BB% same  BB% next
    drop thin cells     .914       .812         .796       .565      .440
    CASCADE             .972       .840         .809       .573      .439

Wins coverage 6/6, reliability 6/6, persistence 5/5, same-season walks 6/6,
ties next-season walks. r(drop, cascade) = 0.987 on the displayed scale;
the movers are thin-arsenal relievers whose secondary pitches had been
excluded, which is the intended effect.

KNOWN BIAS — LOW VOLUME IS STILL SOMEWHAT FLATTERED (measured, 6/6 seasons,
scripts/research/commandplus/commandplus_volume_fallback.py). Targets are fit on the same pitches
they score, and that fit hugs the data harder when there is less of it.
Downsampling high-volume pitchers to reliever scale makes their miss
SMALLER, by these display points:

    N=400  +0.78    N=600  +0.84    N=900  +0.60    N=1300  +0.35
    (six-season means; the pre-cascade scorer measured 2.35 / 1.67 / 1.00 /
     0.56, so the cascade cut it by two thirds and won 24/24 comparisons)

Two mechanisms drove the old bias, MIN_CELL truncation and in-sample
optimism, and they were NOT separable by argument — the cascade could have
deepened the optimism half, since a rescued 20-pitch bucket is where a
fitted mean hugs its own points hardest. Measurement settled it: truncation
dominated. What remains is nearly flat across sample size (0.78 / 0.84 /
0.60 / 0.35 rather than a steep decay), which is the signature of in-sample
optimism with the volume-dependent component removed.

The sample-dependent K caps were also suspected and were NOT a driver: the
v1 GMM measured 2.35 at N=400 against K=1's 2.41.

It does not invert anything — real high-volume arms command ~4 points better,
so the artifact shrinks a true gap rather than inventing one.

VALIDATION HEADLINES (2021-2025 per-season replicates + 2026, never pooled).
The v1 GMM scorer measured 0.795 reliability / 0.793 persistence; the K=1
scorer above measures 0.812 / 0.791 on the ladder harness (common pool,
game-date halves) and wins every objective in every season. Because
r(GMM, K=1) = 0.990, everything below carries over unchanged:
  inter-season persistence ~0.79 (four clean year-pairs; Loc+ ~0.4);
  +0.85 agreement with release-angle repeatability
  (independent kinematics route — external validation); predicts NEXT-season
  BB% beyond current BB% (+0.08..+0.26) and beyond Loc+ (+0.14..+0.33) in
  4/4 pairs. It does NOT predict future xRV beyond Loc+ and velocity — the
  site copy must frame it as execution repeatability that forecasts walk
  rate, not a run-prevention claim. A real velocity tradeoff exists
  (r ~ +0.3 with FF velo, every season).

ROC/AAA: command is SELF-REFERENTIAL — a pitcher's misses vs his own
targets — so ROC needs no MLB baseline translation (unlike Stuff+/Loc+).
ROC pitchers are scored from their own pitches and excluded from the
normalization pool, per the site convention.

Normalization: commandPlus = 200 - 100 * miss / lg_miss over the qualified
MLB pool (higher = better command). One point is one percent: a 115 misses by
15% less distance than league average. The anchor is recomputed from the pool
on every run — there is no stored scale constant to re-fit when the scorer
changes.

Pure Python by design (no numpy/sklearn in the pipeline).
