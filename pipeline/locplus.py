"""Loc+ (Location+) — decomposition-based per-pitch location-quality metric.

The pitcher analog of a command grade: "is this pitcher putting pitches in
valuable spots, given the count, pitch type, and matchup, independent of his
stuff or what the hitter happened to do?"

MODEL (rebuilt 2026-06). For each pitch we look up the league-average
EXPECTED hitter-perspective run value of a pitch of that type/handedness at
that exact plate location, in that count, then average across the pitcher's
pitches and normalize. Lower expected RV = better location for the pitcher.

The expected value is a DECOMPOSITION over smooth league surfaces:

  ExpRV(x, z | grp, hands, count) =
      Pswing(count) · [ Pwhiff(count)·rvWhiff(count) + Pfoul·rvFoul(count)
                        + Pbip·( xwOBAcon(x,z) + XWOFF(count) ) ]
    + (1-Pswing(count)) · [ Pcs(count)·rvCS(count) + (1-Pcs(count))·rvBall(count) ]

  - Pwhiff, Pfoul, xwOBAcon, Pcs (called-strike prob) and Pswing are league
    SURFACES over a (PlateX, zone-normalized PlateZ) grid, built per pitch-type
    GROUP × batter-hand × pitcher-hand. Since 2026-08-15 the count enters the
    surfaces too: swing and whiff grids are per count (shrunk toward the
    collapsed grid times a league count multiplier), the contact value carries
    a per-count LEVEL offset XWOFF, and the called-strike surface takes a
    per-count logit shift (CS_COUNT_TRANSFORM). Only the foul surface is
    count-free. The run-value WEIGHTS (rvWhiff/rvFoul/rvCS/rvBall) are
    count-specific. Surfaces are smoothed with an anisotropic separable
    Gaussian (PHYS_X_IN horizontal, PHYS_Z_FRAC of the zone vertical); every
    K_* pseudo-count is in KERNEL-WEIGHTED units, so K and bandwidth are
    coupled (see _smooth).
  - Scoring at TRUE count level (no count-demeaning): empirically this is more
    predictive and no less stuff-independent than demeaning.
  - Contact (xwOBAcon) surface is heavily shrunk toward the group mean because
    location-driven contact suppression is mostly luck (THT command study).

Design choices were validated empirically (see scripts/research/locplus/ and scripts/archive/):
reliability (split-half), stuff-independence (low corr with whiff%/velo), and
predictive validity (first-half score vs second-half xRV allowed). This model
roughly doubles the run-prevention signal of the old 5-zone metric while
becoming markedly more stuff-independent.

Pitch-type groups (validated by clustering value surfaces):
  FF | SI | FC | SL(+ST,SW,SV) | CU(+KC,CS) | CH(+FS,KN,SC) | OTHER

Normalization: displayed Loc+ (overall and per-type) is the plain mean of
per-pitch INTEGER atoms graded against per-group anchors (coherent canon,
2026-07-18) — no reliability shrinkage: N_PRIOR_OVERALL / N_PRIOR_PT are
ZEROED below (the measured r=0.5 crossings, overall 135 + per-group dict,
are documented there but not applied). raw_loc_adj / locRuns100 / zone_loc
still flow through _normalize (mu, sigma from qualified MLB pitchers). ROC
pitchers are scored against the MLB surfaces but excluded from the
(mu, sigma) pool.

# ── Grid + smoothing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The grid BOUNDS were swept 2026-08-30 on 2021-2025 (five independent
# seasons rebuilt self-contained), holding the bin widths fixed so that only
# COVERAGE changed and the smoothing kernels stayed identical throughout.
# Reproduce with scripts/research/locplus/locplus_grid_bounds_sweep.py.
#
# The decider is `raw`: first-half Loc+ against second-half actual run value,
# paired across seasons. The other two objectives are NOT usable in the
# narrowing direction, and this is the whole reason the sweep needed care:
#   - reliability climbs monotonically as the grid shrinks, peaking at
#     X_MAX=0.5 where 55% of pitches are crushed into six bins and `raw` is
#     WORSE than shipped. Smoothing toward a constant buys repeatability by
#     destroying information, so rel is a DIAGNOSTIC here, not an objective.
#   - the velocity-controlled partial inflates for a second, purely
#     mechanical reason: r(Loc+, velo) rises .130 -> .165 as X_MAX shrinks
#     (t=9.5, 5/5), and with r(velo, RV) negative that lifts the partial even
#     while `raw` is flat.
#
# X: `raw` sits on a plateau spanning roughly 1.0-1.5 ft, bracketed on BOTH
# sides (0.5 ft +.1931, shipped 1.5 ft +.1953, 2.5 ft +.1902). Widening is
# significantly worse — 1.667 t=-3.6, 2.0 t=-5.4, 2.5 t=-5.0, each 0/5
# seasons. Narrowing is flat: every value 0.5-1.333 lands inside one SE, and
# win counts collapse to 2/5 at the extremes. 1.5 is the point in that
# plateau with the least velocity contamination, so it stays.
# Corollary, measured: do NOT widen the grid to give hit-by-pitches real
# surface instead of a clamped edge bin. That was the motivating idea on
# 2026-08-30 and this sweep killed it.
X_MIN, X_MAX = -1.5, 1.5            # feet (plate center = 0)
# BIN_X_IN is the ONE home for the horizontal bin width. It used to be
# hardcoded as a bare `2.0` in _KX, _kernels_for and the shipped config dict
# while BIN_Z was single-homed, so changing BIN_X silently changed the
# PHYSICAL smoothing bandwidth as well as the resolution — the exact trap
# that would invalidate any sweep of it (found 2026-08-30).
# Width swept 1-4 inches on 2021-2025 at constant physical bandwidth: RAW
# moves 0.0013 across the whole range and every paired test is flat
# (|t| <= 1.62), i.e. the objective is SHOWN FLAT, not optimised. 2 inches is
# therefore a CONVENTION trading heatmap display resolution against cell
# count (792 cells at 1 inch vs 198 at 4), not a measured optimum.

BIN_X = BIN_X_IN / 12.0
NX = int(round((X_MAX - X_MIN) / BIN_X))           # 18
# Z: the bounds are a symmetric margin of 0.6 zone-heights beyond each edge,
# and that margin was swept 0.2-1.0. `raw` climbs steeply to 0.6 and then
# SATURATES (0.6 +.1953, 0.8 +.1959, 1.0 +.1956) — structurally, not
# statistically: only 2.3% of pitches remain outside the grid at 0.8 and 1.0%
# at 1.0, so there is nothing left to admit. Narrower is worse (0.2 t=-2.7,
# 0.4 t=-1.9, both 0/5). Wider is inside one SE (0.8 t=0.8, 1.0 t=0.3, 3/5)
# and would grow NZ 22 -> 26, enlarging every shipped heatmap payload and
# changing js/player-page.js rendering, for a number indistinguishable from
# zero. Unlike the X direction, all three objectives agree here.
Z_MIN, Z_MAX = -0.6, 1.6           # zone-normalized (0 = bottom, 1 = top)
# BIN_Z: 0.10 stays. REJECTED 2026-08-30 — a grid-offset change that looked
# strong on 2021-2025 and then REVERSED on the live season. Recorded in full
# so nobody re-derives it.
#
# What looked real: swept 0.05-0.20 at constant physical bandwidth, every
# width from 0.05 to 0.1375 scores RAW .1962-.1970 EXCEPT 0.10, alone at
# .1953 — a hole at exactly the shipped value, confirmed by a fill-in run
# where all four neighbours beat it. Apparent cause: with Z_MIN=-0.6 a 0.10
# bin puts grid EDGES exactly on znorm 0.0 and 1.0, the zone boundaries
# where called-strike probability steps hardest. Sliding the grid half a bin
# (Z_MIN/Z_MAX -0.65/1.55, NZ unchanged) so those boundaries sit at bin
# CENTRES scored +.0029, t=4.09, 5/5 seasons, and the offset curve peaked at
# exactly half a bin and fell off symmetrically toward alignment. Offset is
# cyclic mod BIN_Z, so that was a bracketed interior optimum, and the width
# sweep agreed: 0.10 and 0.20 are the grid-aligned widths and the two worst.
#
# Why it is rejected: the 2026 replicate (live season, run on the production
# cache) reverses it. Half-bin offset scores -.0038 vs shipped, 0/2 halves;
# 0.075 also flips negative; only the QUARTER-bin offset is positive, so the
# symmetric-peak shape that made the mechanism credible does not reproduce
# either. Five agreeing seasons plus a sixth that reverses is the same trap
# already in the notes with the signs swapped (a 2026-tuned config that lost
# 5/5 on 2021-2025). The live season is the deployment target and it does
# not confirm.
# Caveat, stated because it cuts against the rejection: 2026 was partial
# (155 dates), its signal is weaker throughout (RAW ~.129 vs ~.195), and its
# pairing unit is two halves, so it cannot confirm the finding either. A
# change that reverses sign on the season it would ship into still does not
# meet the bar. Re-test on the full 2026 season before reopening.
# SETTLED 2026-09-02: on FULL-season surfaces (the production sample size;
# scripts/research/locplus/locplus_fullseason_replicate.py) both variants are
# FLAT on 2021-2026: half-bin offset raw -0.0003 +/- 0.0013 (3/6), width 0.11
# -0.0002 +/- 0.0007 (3/6). The 5/5, t 4-5 wins above were an artifact of the
# QUARTER-season surfaces the old harness builds. 0.10 stays as a convention.

# wins every pitcher objective: rendered +0.011 (6/6, t 5.7), rendered
# velo-partial +0.012 (6/6), raw +0.010 (4/6), raw velo-partial +0.011 (5/6),
# with the smallest SEs of any wider arm, and it improves the live 2026
# season on all four. 9-13 / 0.40 (the velo-controlled argmax, +0.021) is
# deferred to a full-2026 re-test: larger but season-heterogeneous. Impact on
# the 2026 board: pitcher Loc+ r .990 vs the old bandwidth, mean move 0.7
# pts, max 3.9; per-pitch atoms move ~10 pts on average, so every Sheets
# grade cell and daily-card Loc+ changed with this commit. Every K_* below is
# in kernel-weighted units, so this also weakens each K by ~45% (the cell-fit
# direction); K values were left as they were (pitcher-level flat).
# PROVENANCE (added 2026-09-02; the values had none). Set in June 2026 on
# ~3 months of one season by archive/locplus_final_validate.py, grid 3.5-5.5
# in and 0.17-0.28, on a composite that included reliability. Replicates
# tested only narrower x (3.0/2.5/1.5, shipped won 5/5) and never varied z.
# Re-measured 2026-09-02 on two objectives that DISAGREE:
#   (1) out-of-sample CELL fit (train one full season, score another, 30
#       pairs; locplus_cellfit_sweep.py): every surface prefers NARROWER,
#       interior optimum ~2 in / 0.12 for whiff, foul, contact (1.5 / 0.12
#       swing; the called-strike step wants ~1 in / <0.04), 30/30 pairs.
#   (2) pitcher-level prediction on FULL-season surfaces (first-half Loc+ vs
#       second-half luck-neutral xRV, 2021-2026; the metric's PURPOSE):
#       narrower LOSES 0/6 (2 in / 0.12: rendered -0.014, t -3.7) and
#       moderately WIDER WINS: 6 in / 0.30 rendered +0.011 (6/6, t 5.7),
#       raw +0.010 (4/6), velo-partial +0.011 (5/6); the velo-controlled
#       objective peaks near 9-13 in / 0.40 (+0.021), beyond which gains
#       grow but turn season-heterogeneous (2025 and 2026 disagree on z).
#       Stuff+ leak does not rise with smoothing (r -0.18 -> -0.16).
# Reading: smoothing at the scale of a pitcher's command scatter isolates the
# location value he can intend; the cell objective rewards structure he
# cannot target. For a PITCHER grade, objective (2) decides, so 4.5 / 0.22
# is NOT an optimum: it sits on the rising side of the pitcher-level curve.
# Left in place because a bandwidth change redefines every atom and the
# command map; the choice (6/0.30 conservative, ~9-13/0.40 argmax of the
# velo-controlled objective) is Wally's. Results:
# data/_loc_fullseason_replicate_{cellfit,wide,widegrid}.json.
# DECIDED 2026-09-17 (Wally): 6.0 / 0.30 STAYS, as the DESCRIPTIVE choice.
# scripts/research/locplus/locplus_target_audit.py re-read objective (2) with
# what it lacked (actual RV, a next-season test, a paired bootstrap, a
# Stuff+ partial, a count-mix partial, the full 2026 season, five in-season
# cutoffs, a joint K sweep). Correction to the note above: the Stuff+
# relation DOES fade with smoothing (rendered Loc+ vs out-of-sample Stuff+
# r -.11 at 6/0.30, .00 at 13/0.75), which is why the uncontrolled objective
# rises to the grid edge; controlled, the PREDICTIVE optimum is interior at
# 9 in / 0.55 (+0.019 next season, z 3.2, 5/5; survives the count-mix
# control; K flat). It was not adopted because it halves the surface's
# range, blurs the zone edge and erases the slider chase pocket, and because
# Pitcher+, hpERA and the outing Pitching+ gain nothing from it (outing
# -0.0014, 0/5 folds). Displayed atoms describe; the composites forecast. A
# predictive sibling would start from 9 / 0.55, gates FF 30 / SI 35 / FC 26
# / SL 26 / CU 29 / CH 42. A pitcher-level win alone is not a reason to move
# these two numbers again.

#   pitcher level (full-season surfaces, 2021-2026): the cell-fit K's are

#   |d| 0.28 pts, but per-pitch atoms move 3.1 pts on average (41% by >= 3)
#   because less-shrunk surfaces carry more spatial contrast.

# cells, so charging it to a pitcher understates his reliability), and each
# cell is split RANDOMLY (the displayed number estimates a season aggregate, so
# a chronological split would wrongly charge for in-season drift).
# The superseded values came from locplus_nprior_multiseed.py, which measured
# at the (pitcher, GROUP) level — a different unit that pools a pitcher's CH
# with his FS. Five of six moved <15% and the old values sit inside the new
# seed spread; CH moved 104 -> 72 with a seed range of 62-82 that excludes the
# old value, consistent with that pooling inflating k for the most
# heterogeneous group.

# position-player tag (see EXCLUDE_PT) — so this is a safety net for a genuinely
# novel pitch type appearing mid-season. Policy, not a measurement: don't color
# what we can't validate. (It replaced a hardcoded 135, the old (pitcher,
# group)-level OVERALL crossing, which looked measured but was never a gate
