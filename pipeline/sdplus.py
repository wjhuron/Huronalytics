"""SD+ (Swing Decisions+) — per-pitch decision-quality metric.

Builds a 120-cell (5 zones × 12 counts × 2 decisions; category-collapsed
since 2026-08-15, see the CATS block) run-value weight table from
league-wide MLB pitch data, then scores each
hitter on the decision-value of their own decisions (swing/take) using the
league cell weights, reweighted to the league zone mix. 100 = league-average
decision-maker.

Design highlights (config validated 2026-07-02, scripts/research/hitter/phase2_sdct_harness.py
+ scripts/research/hitter/phase2_sdplus_extensions.py):
- Zone classification: Baseball Savant attack zones, applied to the hitter-
  specific SzTop/SzBot (which already incorporate the ABS adjustment in
  this pipeline). Five buckets: heart / shadow_in / shadow_out / chase /
  waste. Shadow is split on whether the pitch is a strike (via compute_in_zone).
- Counts: all 12 as-is. Pitch categories: NONE since 2026-08-15 — the
  cat3 dimension failed its permuted-label placebo (see the CATS block).
- RV for cell weights: luck-neutral (xwOBA-based for BIP, -RunExp for
  non-BIP), BIP branch NOT count-anchored (changed 2026-08-15). The
  anchor was adopted 2026-07-02 on a single 2026 split-half; the
  multi-season battery (scripts/research/hitter/hitter_phase2_multiseason.py +
  hitter_phase2b_followup.py) showed removing it wins split-half
  reliability 6/6 seasons 2021-2026 (+0.014-0.026) and next-season
  prediction 3/4 pairs (+0.010), and the edge survives count-neutral
  aggregation — the estimated offsets add noise beyond any count-mix
  effect. CT+ KEEPS its anchor (flat/helpful there); Loc+ rejected the
  same anchor 0/5, so all three models now agree.
- Cell smoothing: Bayesian shrinkage cell → zone, k=CELL_SHRINK_K.
- Aggregation: MIX-NEUTRAL — per-zone mean dv reweighted to the league
  zone distribution, so opportunity (the pitch diet faced) doesn't leak
  into the decision score.
- Per-hitter regression: Bayesian regression toward the league mean with
  n_prior=HITTER_PRIOR_N pseudo-obs (= measured n0, MMSE-optimal).
- Normalization: ratio-to-league ×100 (see regress_and_normalize), NOT a
  z-score scale. Floor: MIN_HITTER_DECISIONS (split-half r=.50 point);
  the MLB 3.1 PA × team_games_played qualification is applied separately
  by the leaderboard consumer.

The decision-value formula is `dv = RV(chosen) - RV(opposite)` — absolute
opportunity cost, not league-relative.
