# pitch numbers are 1-based, so `_00` is unambiguous (verified: zero existing
# PitchIDs end in _00).
#
# The row must COUNT as a plate appearance and, for a hitter, as a walk. It
# must NOT count as a pitch. Every per-pitch denominator therefore has to
# exclude it, and the ones that do were found by measurement rather than by
# reading code — see scripts/research/misc/ibb_injection_test.py, which
# injects rows into the golden harness and diffs the whole pipeline.
#
# Most filters are already safe because they key on a column being None
# (BBType, InZone, Description), which a no-pitch row has. The ones that are
# NOT safe count rows directly, and those are the call sites of real_pitches.

    Statcast's delta_run_exp is built on each league's own run-expectancy
    matrix, so the SAME event carries a larger magnitude in MiLB.

    A SINGLE global factor is not enough — measured 2026-07-25, one WLS slope
    per source cut the weighted cell-level error only 49% -> 21%, and the
    residual was not uniform (Ball over-corrected -7%, Foul under-corrected
    +14% even after holding count mix fixed). The two leagues' RE matrices
    differ in SHAPE, not just scale, so the correction is per (Description,
    Count) cell, with fallbacks:

        cell factor   mlb_mean / milb_mean for that (Description, Count)
        desc factor   same ratio pooled over counts, for thin cells
        global factor WLS slope through the origin, for anything left

    Aligning cell means also neutralizes the leagues' different base-out
    MIX within a cell, which is context the pitcher does not control — the
    same translation framing xwOBAcon / xwOBAsp / Loc+ already use for ROC.
    Crucially it is a MULTIPLIER, not a substitution, so each pitch keeps its
    own base-out variation around that cell mean; replacing values with a
    lookup table would flatten ROC RV to context-neutral while MLB RV stayed
    context-included, making one column mean two different things by source.

    Estimated from NON-BIP cells only. 'In Play' is excluded from ESTIMATION
    because its gap is mostly real — ROC hitters genuinely produce more on
    contact (mean -0.002 vs MLB -0.048) and that must survive as signal, not
    be scaled away — but BIP still RECEIVES the global factor, since
    delta_run_exp is in league run units either way.

    Guards: a ratio is only used when both means clear `min_mag` and share a
    sign, so near-zero cells can't produce exploding or sign-flipping factors.

    Measured every run rather than hardcoded: run environments drift.
