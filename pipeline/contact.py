"""CT+ (Contact+) — per-swing contact-execution index.

Complements SD+ (decision quality) and BB+ (contact quality) to form an
orthogonal three-axis view of plate performance:
    SD+  — did you swing at the right pitch?
    CT+  — did you make contact when you swung, vs expectation?  (this file)
    BB+  — how good was the contact when you made it?

Raw metric: hitter's leverage-weighted ACTUAL contact over leverage-
weighted EXPECTED contact across the same swings:
    raw_ct = Σ (I[contact] × leverage[cell]) / Σ ((1 − p_whiff[cell]) × leverage[cell])
    leverage[cell] = rv_contact[cell] - rv_whiff[cell]
    p_whiff[cell]  = league whiff rate for that (zone × count) cell

League mean ≈ 1.0 by construction. ctPlus = 100 × raw_adj / league_adj
(BB+'s ratio-to-league convention still applies cleanly).

Why expected-contact in the denominator (2026-07-02 change): the previous
raw contact-rate form let swing selection leak in — chase-prone hitters
scored low CT+ partly through WHERE they swung, double-counting what SD+
already measures. Dividing by the league contact expectation for the same
swings removes the mix and leaves pure contact execution. Validated:
split-half r 0.60→0.67, stabilization n0 127→95 swings
(scripts/research/hitter/phase2_sdct_harness.py).

Why leverage weighting: 2-strike whiffs matter far more than 0-0 whiffs
because rv_whiff ≈ K (very negative) at 2K while a 0-0 whiff is just a
strike added. Heart-zone whiffs cost more than chase-zone whiffs because
rv_contact ≈ high xwOBA on heart contact. The (rv_contact - rv_whiff)
weighting makes high-stakes contact count more toward the hitter's score.

Cell RVs are count-anchored (build_bip_count_offsets) so BIP and whiff
values share the count-conditional delta-RE currency. (SD+ dropped its
anchor 2026-08-15; CT+ keeps it — the toggle was flat on reliability and
slightly negative on prediction in the multi-season battery.)

Cells are (zone × count × FB/BRK/OFF) since 2026-08-15, with the same
cascade shrinkage as SD+: cell → (zone × cat) → zone, k=CELL_SHRINK_K
per level.
The old "pitch-type expansion added <1% residual variance" claim did not
survive replicate testing — cat3 wins next-season prediction 4/4 pairs
(+0.005) and wins at the Hitter+ composite level
(scripts/research/hitter/hitter_phase2b_followup.py, hitterplus_weights_v2.py).

cat3 is justified by PREDICTION ONLY. Its split-half reliability gain is
NOT evidence and must not be quoted as such: the permuted-label placebo in
scripts/research/hitter/hitter_meta_validation.py reproduces it and then
some. Measured 2026-08-19 over 18 season-seed cells, 2021-2026:

    ct_zc (no cat3)      rel 0.7123
    ct_cat3 (shipped)    rel 0.7157     beats the placebo in only 2/18
    ct_cat3_placebo      rel 0.7216     beats no-cat3 in 18/18

So the whole reliability gain is parameter flexibility. The predictive
separation is the real signal — there the placebo (+0.0131) is
indistinguishable from no cat3 (+0.0132) while real cat3 reaches +0.0178.
A prior comment here claimed the 6/6 reliability win as supporting
evidence; it does not survive its own placebo.
