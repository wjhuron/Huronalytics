"""pipeline_eraplus.py — hdERA and hpERA (+ their 100-scale twins).

hdERA (deserved ERA, descriptive): what the pitcher's season deserves on
the ERA scale, luck stripped. Single channel by measurement — every
second channel was swept and rejected (FIP's gain is 95% its HR term,
HR/FB self-r 0.12; freed K/BB/xwOBAcon weights LOSE to packaged xwOBA in
every replicate season).

    hdERA = poolERA + DH_B * z(xwOBA against, shrunk at N0_XW PA)

hpERA (projected ERA, going forward): the Pitcher+ component set plus
role and park, calibrated to future ERA. Weights are the fold-mean OLS
fit on rest-of-season replicates 2021-2026 (one weight set serves both
horizons: next-season transfer cost 0.001). Held-out r: 0.51 next
season, 0.48 rest-of-season at the 60 IP gate — beats SIERA in all 11
replicates.

    hpERA = poolERA + sum_c W_PH[c] * z(channel_c) + W_LHP * (lhp - poolLHPshare)

Channels (ERA direction, i.e. higher value = more expected runs).
NOTE (corrected 2026-08-27): xw feeds hdERA only — W_PH carries no xw
term; the eight hpERA channels are the rest of this table.

    lhp    left-handed pitcher indicator, RAW and centered at the pool's
           LHP share (2026-09-05): without it LHP beat the forecast by
           0.11-0.20 ERA in 17 of 22 replicates, because the stuff channel
           grades their physics ~0.7 SD worse while their outcomes match
           RHP and Loc+ offsets only part of that. A calibration term for
           the FORECAST; deliberately not a Stuff+ feature (Loc+ already
           embeds the LHP outcome premium through its per-hand-pair
           surfaces, so it would be counted twice here).

The 100-scale twins mirror wRC+/ERA- construction (a labeled convention,
not a fit): hdERA+ = 200 - 100 * hdERA / poolERA, higher = better,
average 100; likewise hpERA+. Their spread is genuine run-prevention
information (SD ~23 and ~19), landing naturally in wRC+ territory.

Shrinkage constants were measured by scripts/research/era/era_shrinkage_sweep.py
(split-half, interior optima in every replicate season); weights and
slopes by scripts/research/era/era_weights_final.py; full provenance in
data/era_final_constants.json and the 2026-08-15 research notes. The
2026-09-05 hand refit: scripts/research/era/era_hand_weight_refit.py on
replicates rebuilt by era_targets_build.py (MLB Stats API lines), the
battery/cmdloc/xrv builders and era_stuff_loso_v2.py; result in
data/_era_hand_refit.json.

Called from stuff_plus/train_stuff.py --inject (needs the fresh
stuffScore, like Pitcher+). Keys survive process_data-only runs via
XRVOE_KEYS carry-over.

hWAR (2026-09-05): a deserved pitcher WAR on hdERA. One pitcher-season:

    RA9_d   = hdERA + (lgRA9 - lgERA)                 earned runs -> runs, the league gap (fWAR does this to FIP)
    RA9_dp  = RA9_d - WAR_PARK_PASS * (exposure - 1) * lgRA9 + shift
              exposure = (PF_home/100 + 1)/2 (half the games at home; combined rows resolve
              through combined_park_map); shift recenters the innings-weighted MLB mean to
              lgRA9, so runs above average sum to zero across the league (the hdERA anchor is
              the 30-IP pool, whose mean is not the league's)
    RAA     = (lgRA9 - RA9_dp) * IP / 9
    hWAR    = RAA / RPW + REPL * IP / 9
    RPW     = 4 r / (2 r)^WAR_PYTH_EXP with r = lgRA9, one season constant (the per-pitcher
              run-environment form is coded behind WAR_DYNAMIC_RPW and held off by decision).
              Team records read 10-11.7 (n 30, curvature)
    hWAR_se = (DH_B / sd_pool) x shrink x WAR_XW_PA_SD / sqrt(PA) x IP/9 / RPW   sampling error bar,
              on the runs scale hdERA itself uses (DH_B per pool SD of shrunk xwOBA, about 53
              runs/9 per xwOBA point; the linear-weights scale PA9/wOBAscale is 31 and reads 1.7x
              too narrow: war_error_bar.py, split-half variance ratio 1.09 on this scale)
    REPL    = REPL_RP + (REPL_SP - REPL_RP) * GS/G,  REPL_RP = REPL_SP - WAR_ROLE_GAP / RPW
    REPL_SP = [ target + (WAR_ROLE_GAP / RPW) x sum over MLB club rows of (1 - GS/G) x IP/9 ] / sum of IP/9
              target = (1 - WAR_POOL_SHARE_HITTERS) x WAR_POOL x lgGames / WAR_POOL_GAMES
              (2026-09-14) the starter bar is SOLVED each run so the club-row total is exactly
              the pitcher share of the pool, the rule the hitter side already used (hwar.py pins
              its per-PA replacement to the 57 percent share). fWAR's published 0.12 wins per 9
              is the OUTPUT of that pin in a normal season; borrowed as a fixed input it left the
              pitcher pool 8 percent short (356.7 of 393.5 on 2026-09-14) for no measured reason.
              The role gap stays fixed in runs, so the pin is one top-up per inning for every
              pitcher (+0.0084 wins per 9 in 2026: +0.17 at 180 IP, +0.06 at 65). No lgGames in
              metadata, or a solved bar outside WAR_REPL_SP_BAND, keeps the fixed WAR_REPL_SP
              and says so.

Improvement battery (2026-09-05, scripts/research/era/war_improve_battery.py + _battery2.py,
war_calibration_slope.py; data/_war_improve_battery*.json). The rate is at a plateau: the
xwOBA shrink N0 0-1000 moves nothing outside noise (250 stays), the linear-weights form
(xwRAA) and K%/BB% channels lose, an xRV blend wins two objectives narrowly but loses
reliability. Per-pitch channels: framing runs RECEIVED are half-stable (rel .43) and carry
a NEGATIVE next-season weight, so neutralizing the catcher would remove pitcher signal
(rejected); pulled-air excess predicts next season 5/5 at 60 IP but loses reliability 0/6
(the fixed per-BIP form was tested the same day in war_pullair_fixed.py and REJECTED: nxt60 up 5/5 at every C, rel and ros down 0-1/6, no exchange rate); running game and
WP/BK lose everywhere; the pitcher's actual home-pitch share changes nothing. Calibration:
the same-season slope of actual RA9 on the rate reads .86 because of selection on outcomes
(low-IP arms 1.33, high-IP .76, the winner's-curse signature), not over-dispersion, so
DH_B stays. Volume stays innings (TBF-based moves nobody more than .6 WAR and credits
dominance less). Role variable stays start share: innings per appearance explains none
of the within-pitcher change.

Why hdERA: three WARs built under identical conventions on the 2021-2026 replicates
(scripts/research/era/war_rate_validation.py, data/_war_rate_validation.json), differing only
in the rate. hdERA vs FIP: half-season reliability .467 vs .407 (5/6), next-season RA9 at 60 IP
.355 vs .342 (3/5), at 30 IP .263 vs .229 (5/5), rest-of-season .328 vs .303, and on the 50
pitchers per season where FIP-WAR and RA9-WAR disagree most .310 vs .270. Actual RA9 loses
every test (reliability .212). No leverage term, by decision: it credits the manager's
deployment, the same job-versus-pitcher line Pitcher+ drew. No league correction (one MLB
pool) and no opponent adjustment. Relievers are not credited for the job; the role split in
replacement CORRECTS the rate inflation the job gives them (WAR_ROLE_GAP 0.85 runs/9,
measured within season on swingmen who did both jobs; the adjacent-season version reads
0.64 and is a floor, because demoted starters rebound and promoted relievers are the good
ones; fWAR's split implies about the same 0.85). ROC rows have no hdERA and therefore no
hWAR.

ROC/AAA ROWS SCORE hpERA AND NOT hdERA (2026-08-19). They are scored
against the MLB pool and never enter it -- no league rate, no z statistic,
no anchor -- the same translation framing Stuff+, Loc+ and xRVOE already
use for Rochester. The split is measured, not assumed: on ~800 pitcher-
seasons appearing at both levels in the same season, 2023-2025
(scripts/research/era/aaa_level_correction.py), the within-pitcher shift
is +0.077 ERA for hpERA and +0.765 for hdERA. hpERA survives because its
channels cancel and hdERA does not because it is nearly pure xwOBA. Their
home park is NEUTRAL: Savant publishes no minor-league park factors, so
the park channel z-scores a flat 1.00 for every ROC row. Neutral now
stands by MEASUREMENT, not just data absence (2026-08-21,
scripts/research/era/aaa_park_channel_validation.py): BA 2025 AAA park
factors were tested against next-season road xwOBA on 2023-2026 AAA
pitcher-seasons, and neither the naive forward channel nor the
retrodictive xrv correction beat the neutral baseline in the IL-only
decision test (park-partial sign flips across year-pairs). Note the
direction trap recorded there: for a translated arm the fitted forward
park weight points the WRONG way, so if factors ever improve, re-test
the retrodictive form, never just activate the channel.

def combined_park_map(rows, park, aaa_teams, is_combined_fn):
    """{id(row) -> home park factor} for every combined 2TM/3TM/... row:
    the park of the club the pitcher MOST RECENTLY pitched for
    (current_team_by_player, the same lastGameDate resolution the
    qualification denominator uses).

    A combined row carries a LABEL, not a franchise, so park.get('2TM')
    has always fallen through to a neutral 100 -- and a traded pitcher
    did not pitch in a neutral park.

    MOST-RECENT CLUB, not IP-weighted history, by measurement (2026-08-24,
    scripts/research/era/era_park_weight_refit.py + _era_team_outs.json).
    Two facts came out of that battery:
      1. The shipped W_PH['park'] = 0.168 was fit on FINAL-CLUB exposure
         all along: the bulk stats endpoint returns one season-combined
         row per pitcher with only the last club attached, so the
         harness's "mean over clubs" never saw a second club. (An earlier
         version of this docstring believed otherwise.)
      2. Re-fit on true per-stint exposure (person-hydrate pull),
         IP-weighted history LOSES to final-club in every LOSO test
         (ROS g60 1/6 folds, -.0023 mean r; NEXT g60 1/5, -.0028).
         hpERA forecasts future runs, and the future innings come at the
         CURRENT club's park, so where he pitched BEFORE the trade is the
         worse proxy.
    So production now matches both the fit convention and the measured
    best: a combined row scores the park of its most recent club. The
    previous IP-weighted convention shipped 2026-08-19..2026-08-24.

    ROC/AAA stints are excluded by current_team_by_player: a pitcher sent
    down still resolves to his last MLB club.
