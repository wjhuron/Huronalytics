"""window_pool.py — score ONE hitter over ANY date range, ranked against the
SEASON pool.

THE RULE (Wally, 2026-08-18, after I got this wrong twice):

    The VALUES come from the date range. The PERCENTILES come from the
    season, for everybody. There is no sample-size gate.

So a three-week window that produces an elite rate reads as an elite
percentile, because that is the point: "for these three weeks he was the best
hitter in baseball." Comparing a pre-break window to a post-break window then
works, because both are ranked against the same fixed season ruler.

WHAT I BUILT FIRST AND THREW AWAY. A window-specific all-MLB pool: every
hitter recomputed over the same range, percentiles ranked inside it, cell
tables rebuilt over the window. That is a different and worse question. It
made every window its own ruler, so two windows were not comparable to each
other, and it needed a qualification gate that returned nothing on short
ranges. It also mirrored ~150 lines of process_data sequencing and grew four
bugs in an afternoon. None of that is needed.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD:
  * window values: computed from the window's pitches by the pipeline's own
    functions (compute_hitter_stats, compute_expected_stats).
  * BB+ / SD+ / CT+ / Process+: the hitter's WINDOW pitches scored against the
    SEASON league anchors and cell tables, so the number means "at season
    league rates, this is what he did over the window".
  * percentiles: the window value's rank inside the SHIPPED season
    leaderboard's distribution for that stat, honouring HITTER_INVERT_PCTL.
    No minimum PA, no qualification, no pool rebuild.
