"""train_stuff.py — Stuff+ trainer (live config: BUNDLE_VERSION below;
version notes sit above BASE_FEATS).

A from-scratch rebuild of v10 in mid-2026. The architecture that won:
  - ONE pooled model across pitch types (not 9 per-type models)
  - ONE learned luck-neutral xRV target (not hand-weighted whiff/GB/contact)
  - lean physics-only feature set (no SSW residuals, no location)

Current telemetry (data/stuff_metrics_history.csv, 2026-09): OOF descriptive
|r| ~0.31 at the (pitcher, type) unit; split-half reliability ~0.97, which is
INFLATED because every fold's training set carries each pitcher's own
2021-2025 rows; next-season pitcher-level r 0.37-0.49 per 2021-26 pair
(scripts/research/stuff/stuff_gate_v2.py, the adoption gate).

Offline trainer (xgboost is fine here): trains on the cleaned pitch pickle,
scores every MLB pitch OUT-OF-FOLD (pitcher-grouped, so no pitcher's own
outcomes train the model that scores him), standardizes to 100 +/- 10 PER
PITCH TYPE, aggregates to (pitcher, team, pitch_type), and (optionally, with
--inject) writes stuffScore + stuffScore_pctl into the pitch leaderboard.

Usage:
    python3 stuff_plus/train_stuff.py            # train + save bundle/CSV
    python3 stuff_plus/train_stuff.py --inject    # also write into leaderboard

#   every public reference model carries it
# - movement features are the DENSITY-ADJUSTED xIndVrtBrk/xHorzBrk (flat on

#   quantity the site displays, and altitude pitchers stop eating a
#   systematic stuff penalty for their home air)
# - monotone velocity constraint (rel +0.008, pred flat): more velo, same
#   everything else, never grades worse — kills sparse-region artifacts
# 2026-07-07 feature-weighting audit (scripts/stuff_weight_audit.py): rel_z
# DROPPED — redundant with arm_angle (r=0.78) and actively harmful; removing
# it improves pred future xRV 0.304 -> 0.315 (8-fold, seeds 0/1/2), desc
# +0.007, reliab +0.002, and helps the no-arm ROC companion (pred 0.258 ->
# 0.272). It double-penalized low-slot arms (Kevin Kelly SI 96 -> 111; SI
# desc r 0.461 -> 0.488). RelPosZ stays in build_df rows/row-filter so the

# real descriptive value; arm_angle is tied-most load-bearing (pred -0.049

# LOSO 2021-2025 replicate gate (scripts/research/stuff/stuff_features_loso.py):
#   1. cross/cross_abs replace axis_dev/axis_dev_abs — the same SSW quantity
#      restated in release-axis-frame INCHES (linear in movement, stable for
#      gyro sliders where circular degrees have sd ~40).
#   2. velo_diff masked to None on FF/SI — the gap off the primary fastball
#      is real signal for cutters/breaking/offspeed (masking it there crashed
#      breaking pred -0.08) but actively harmful bookkeeping on the true
#      fastballs themselves (masking FF/SI: fastball pred 0.217 -> 0.266).
#   3. vaa/vaa_diff are nVAA — location-adjusted via frozen per-type slopes
#      (NVAA_SLOPES below). Raw VAA doubled as a pitch-height proxy, i.e.
#      location leakage in a skill-isolation model (locIndep 0.39 -> 0.29).
# Combined 2026 harness: reliab 0.8818 -> 0.9685, pred 0.2878 -> 0.3057,
# desc 0.3821 -> 0.3496 (the desc drop is the evicted location component).
# LOSO: CROSS_VD beat shipped on pitcher-level fut_r in 4/5 held-out seasons
# (rel 5/5); adding nVAA was prediction-neutral across replicates (3/5, mean
# +0.007) while gaining +0.05 reliability in all five.

# The concern does NOT materialize: every joint value is positive, so a harder
# breaking ball still grades better, just by less than raw velocity alone would
# give. The curveball is the LEAST penalized secondary (-0.72). The pitch where
# separation nearly cancels velocity is the CHANGEUP (+0.20 net, the gap eating

# A Stuff+ number is only as good as the training data near the pitch. For each
# MLB (pitcher, team, pitch_type) unit we measure how close its feature centroid
# sits to the data that actually trains the model scoring it: mean z-scored
# BASE_FEATS-space Euclidean distance to the SUPPORT_K nearest pitches in a
# random <=SUPPORT_POOL_MAX subsample of the training pool. The pool EXCLUDES
# the pitcher's own current-season pitches (mirroring production OOF, where his
# own 2026 outcomes never train the model that scores him) but KEEPS his
# prior-season pitches — cross-season identity is real support (2025 Tyler
# Rogers supports 2026 Tyler Rogers, so Rogers must NOT flag). Because the
# subsample dilutes a single pitcher's rows ~20x (which falsely flagged
# Rogers's sweeper despite 249 supporting 2025 pitches), the unit pitcher's
# own prior-season pitches are ALWAYS in his neighbor pool at full density,
# appended per-unit alongside the shared subsample. The worst
# (100 - SUPPORT_FLAG_PCT)% of units flag as low-support; surfaced as
# stuffScore_lowSupport on both leaderboards, a tooltip note on the site, and
# a dagger on season cards. ROC/AAA units (2026-09-11, per Wally) are scored
# for support the same way, as EXTRA centroids against the same MLB manifold:
# they never enter the pool, and they never enter the flag percentile (the
# line is set on MLB units alone, so ROC cannot set its own line). Before
# this they were hard-coded False, which read as "supported" when it meant
# "not checked". Nicolas (the test case) sits at the 63rd pctl at worst.
